Dear party coordinator, 

Hello. 
I heard from V that the organization is holding a party. 
For the five years I've known him, I've always admired his generosity and deeds. I'm sure the party will be splendid if V is involved. Could you please elaborate on what kind of party it is? 
I look forward to your reply. 

Sincerely, Photographer Rui.
</div><div>It's a extravagant and elegant party.</div><div><div>Hello, Rui. 
<br>
<br>Thank you for taking interest in the party. I'm {0}, the party coordinator. 
<br>The party will be very luxurious and elegant. We plan to have French wine and dessert cakes shaped like jewels, so please come!
<br>Have a good day. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>I must taste the wine! I'm sure my camera will capture all those beautiful cakes. 
<br>I have a Olymbus X20 and Sonya CP160. Which model do you recommend I take? 
<br>
<br>Best, Rui
<br></div></div></div><div>I recommend you take the Olymbus X20.</div><div><div>Hi Rui, 
<br>
<br>I think the Olymbus X20 would be better, since that model offers a much better quality setting. You shouldn't miss a single sparkle in those cakes. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>{0},
<br>
<br>You really know your camera! I'm more excited for the party since someone familiar with cameras is involved. I'll have to think more about taking the Olymbus X20 since there's good and bad in compact cameras and professional cameras. Should I take the compact camera Olymbus X20 or my professional one Ganon? 
<br>
<br>Rui, 
<br></div></div></div><div>I recommend you take the heavy professional Ganon camera.</div><div><div>Rui, 
<br>
<br>I did not realize that you have a professional Ganon camera. That model is famous for being difficult to handle. Why don't you bring it to the party and explain to everyone how to use it? I'm sure at least one person will have similar interests.
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>{0},
<br>
<br>That's a good idea. 
<br>I'll put it in my schedule. See you at the party. 
<br>All the best,
<br>
<br>Rui
<br></div></div></div><div>I recommend you bring the Olymbus X20.</div><div><div>Rui, 
<br>
<br>I would take the Olymbus X20. Who uses a heavy camera these days? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>{0},
<br>
<br>Do you think so? Alright. 
<br>I'll check my schedule and go if I can make it. 
<br>
<br>Rui. 
<br></div></div></div><div>I recommend you take the Sonya CP160.</div><div><div>Rui, 
<br>
<br>How about the Sonya? It's a cute camera. I can take a photo of you using that camera. Isn't it a great idea, taking photos of someone taking photos? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>{0},
<br>
<br>Hmm... If you consider that a great idea, you have a very unique mindset. 
<br>I am not very interested in getting my photo taken. 
<br>I will go if I have nothing particular to do that day. 
<br>
<br>Rui
<br></div></div></div><div>It's a lovely and cute party.</div><div><div>Hi Rui!
<br>
<br>I'm {0}, the party coordinator. 
<br>Thanks for contacting me. I'm sure you're a great person if you're V's friend. 
<br>The party will look very lovely. We plan to serve fish cakes the shape of pinatas.
<br>I hope you're interested. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>{0},
<br>
<br>Fish cakes the shape of pinatas?! That sounds horrible. 
<br>I don't think this party suits me very well. 
<br>Good bye,

Dear party coordinator, 

Hello, I was offered an invitation to the party by Zen.
The writers at our organization are very excited that he will play the lead part in one of the plays written by our very own. 
He is very popular within our group, so everyone wishes to have him play one of their works. 

As such, if I can meet Zen at the party, I'm sure we'll fall in love at first sight like all the romance novels and oh my gosh
.
...
.....
I greatly wish to meet him in person, so I would like to know if he would attend the party as well. 

Sincerely, Romance Novel Association Representative. 
</div><div>Of course.</div><div><div>Dear, Romance Novel Association Representative, 
<br>
<br>Hello, I am {0}, the party coordinator. 
<br>As Zen is one of the hosts for the party, he will be definitely attending. 
<br>He is looking forward to meeting your association there. I think you will have be able to discuss potential projects with him at the party. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>I am very happy to hear that Zen is attending. But since we are attending not as individuals, but as a group, I wonder how well you know about romance novels. 
<br>Between the two novels written by our association's writers, "Jane and John" which is a love story about a normal married couple and "Your One and Only Top Star" a striking love story with a famous celebrity,
<br>do you know which book sold more? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Romance Novel Association Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>Your One and Only Top Star</div><div><div>Dear Romance Novel Association Representative, 
<br>
<br>I know it to be that "Your One and Only Top Star" sold more books.
<br>I especially enjoyed the tug of war between the two main characters and the thrill of having to hide their love. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0},
<br>
<br>I see that you are familiar with our association.
<br>I've been having a writer's block these days and I would like to ask your opinion on my new novel. 
<br>In the part where the two main leads realize their mutual attraction for the very first time, I wonder whether a kiss or a hug should come first. 
<br>
<br>Best, Romance Novel Association Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>Kiss!</div><div><div>Dear Romance Novel Association Representative,
<br>
<br>I think nothing can beat a passionate and dramatic kiss when portraying love!
<br>And they'll have to hug each other when they kiss, so two birds with one stone!
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0},
<br>
<br>I can tell that you are very familiar with romance novels. Since Zen will be there and you are so reliable, I will make sure to attend the party.
<br>
<br>Best, Romance Novel Association Representative Zen Lover
<br></div></div></div><div>Hug</div><div><div>Dear Romance Novel Association Representative, 
<br>
<br>If they suddenly start kissing, won't it be too promiscuous...? 
<br>I think a cuddly hug will feel cute.
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0},
<br>
<br>A hug won't be very dramatic... but that doesn't sound bad. I will try it. 
<br>I will check my schedule concerning the party and see. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Romance Novel Association Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>Jane and John</div><div><div>Dear Romance Novel Association Representative,
<br>
<br>Wasn't Jane and John more popular since it's about your normal daily life?
<br>I don't really know about the other book since I didn't read it. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>You don't seem to know very much about our organization. 
<br>But since Zen will be there... I will consider attending. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Romance Novel Association Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>Unfortunately...</div><div><div>Dear Romance Novel Association Representative,
<br>
<br>Hello, I am {0}, the party coordinator. 
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, Zen has a busy schedule and will not be attending the party. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>It's a huge shame that Zen is not attending the party...
<br>Our organization had hoped to get the opportunity to talk with Zen at the party, so we will not be attending. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Romance Novel Association Representative

Dear Party Coordinator, 

Hello, we are the Cultured Citizens Organization, a group of elites who enjoy sophisticated activities. 
I actually wanted to discuss the party with Jumin who informed us about it. 
A corporate heir like him is the perfect fit for our organization. He has a thick wallet and he is handsome. 
It was disappointing that we couldn't talk to him but this will have to do for now. 
Oh right, I have to buy my puppy a blanket. Could you recommend a nice brand for me? 

Sincerely, Cultured Citizens Representative
</div><div>Borborry~</div><div><div>Dear Cultured Citizens Representative,
<br>
<br>Hello, I am {0}, the party coordinator. 
<br>I can give you all the information you need instead of Jumin.
<br>I would recommend Borborry, since it is a classic and luxurious brand. 
<br>As I'm sure members of Cultured Citizens enjoy high quality products, the blanket will suit your puppy perfectly!
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0},
<br>
<br>Borborry? What a nice recommendation. You have good taste. 
<br>I have another question. Is the necktie that Jumin wears from Verragamo? 
<br>I would like to know what I can start a conversation about with him.
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Cultured Citizens Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>It is Verragamo.</div><div><div>Dear Cultured Citizens Representative,
<br>
<br>I am glad that you like the brand I recommended. 
<br>Your guess is correct. He does wear Verragamo frequently. 
<br>I am impressed at your quick eye. Indeed, I don't expect anything else from a member of Cultured Citizens. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>Oh, of course. I belong to Cultured Citizens, haha. 
<br>I have one more question to ask. 
<br>Since we are an elite organization, we cannot attend just any parties, so please excuse me having to ask so many questions!
<br>I am curious of what other guests will be attending the party... Will there be many other young handsome men there? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Cultured Citizens Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>Flower bed of pretty boys</div><div><div>Dear Cultured Citizens Representative,
<br>
<br>Jumin will of course be there as well as an actor, college student, computer technician, photographer...
<br>and other many more talented and handsome young men. 
<br>I am sure that it will be the kind of party that you wish for. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div> 
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>I am really liking what I hear. I think that will be my most favorite part. 
<br>From what I get from your email, you seem to have a good understanding of luxuries, so I think the party will be very luxurious as well. 
<br>Then, see you at the party. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Cultured Citizens Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>Swamped with couples</div><div><div>Dear Cultured Citizens Representative,
<br>
<br>There will be a lot of men at the party,
<br>but I think all the good looking ones will be taken. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0},
<br>
<br>Oh... Well... I'm sad to hear that. 
<br>If I find a luxurious dress that will suit the party, I will go. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Cultured Citizens Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>I don't know...</div><div><div>Dear Cultured Citizens Representative, 
<br>
<br>Well, I don't know...
<br>I don't know about men's ties... but... maybe it's from Forever 27? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>Oh god, Forever 27? I am sure that Jumin would never wear something from Forever 27.
<br>If that's your taste... I'm not sure what the party will be like...
<br>I will have to further consider attending the party. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Cultured Citizens Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>FOREVER 27!</div><div><div>Dear Cultured Citizens Representative, 
<br>
<br>Hello, I am {0}, the party coordinator. 
<br>I think the brand Forever 27 will fit the Cultured Citizens very well. 
<br>Of course, you can tell that it's copied from many other brands though. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>Forever 27? How could you recommend such a brand?

Hello, I am the representative of the group Women Artists. 
The members of the Romance Novel Organization introduced Zen to us, and Zen told us about the party. 
I heard it is for charity, but it is difficult for us to spend time with people who are unfamiliar with art.

Between Van Gogh and Monet, who started the Impressionist movement?

<br>
<br>You are correct again. Then this is my last question. What is the Italian word that means to play in a smooth, singing style? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Women Artists Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>Cantabile</div><div><div>Dear Women Artists Representative,
<br>
<br>The answer is cantabile. Tchaikovsky is famous for his use of cantabile. 
<br>I hope this answer helps you have faith in our party. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Party Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Yes, you are right! You've answered all three questions correctly. 
<br>We will attend the party. I very much look forward to it. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Women Artists Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>Cantata</div><div><div>Dear Women Artists Representative, 
<br>
<br>I think it is cantata. The word cantata just feels smooth!
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Party Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Cantata... refers to opera...
<br>I'm sad to say you got one wrong... I will discuss with the members whether or not we will attend the party. 
<br>Hope you expose yourself to more artworks. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Women Artists Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>Metropolitan Museum</div><div><div>Dear Women Artists Representative,
<br>
<br>One of the world's best museums in France must be the Metropolitan Museum! 
<br>It was much easier to answer since you said it's in France. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div> 
<br>Dear Party Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>The Met is one of the world's best museums, but the answer was the Louvre....
<br>I think we will have to consider long and hard about attending the party...
<br>Have a good day, and hope you become more familiar with art.
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Women Artists Representative 
<br></div></div></div><div>Van Gogh</div><div><div>Dear Women Artists Representative, 
<br>
<br>Hello, I am {0}, the party guest coordinator, 
<br>Van Gogh and Monet? Of course it's Van Gogh...!
<br>That was such an easy question.^^
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Party Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Van Gogh...? This was such an easy question and yet you got it wrong...
<br>We will not be attending the party. 
<br>I think you should be more interested in art works. 
<br>
<br>Best, Women Artists Representative

Dear RFA Representative, 

Hello, I am the President of the Barista Association. 
I heard RFA was holding a charity party. I hope the good cause reaches far like coffee aroma does. 
Our association treats top quality coffee beans that produce good aroma and taste. 
What kind of coffee do you enjoy? 

Warmly, Barista Association
</div><div>Arabica coffee!</div><div><div>Dear President of Barista Association,
<br>
<br>Hello, my name is {0}. 
<br>I like to drink arabica coffee! It is relatively pricy but the beans have such a good aroma and the flavor is dense! It doesn't contain much caffeine so it's not too heavy either. 
<br>Writing about it like this makes me want to brew a cup. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>You enjoy drinking good coffee. I look forward to what kind of coffee will be provided at the party. 
<br>Coffee can be made in various ways and the taste and aroma differ according to the method. Do you know what the method of pouring water over ground coffee beans is called? 
<br>
<br>Warmly, President of Barista Association 
<br></div></div></div><div>Drip brewing</div><div><div>Dear President of Barista Association
<br>
<br>Drip brewing! I love coffee hand drip coffee the best! The most fascinating part is that the aroma and taste differ according to who brews it. And because the extracting time is longer, you can enjoy a stronger flavor. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>You know well about hand drip coffee. I hope I get to brew a cup for you that day. 
<br>Do you know what an espresso is? Unlike drip brewing, you use a machine that extracts coffee with very hot steam. 
<br>A pop quiz for you. What country does the word espresso come from?
<br>
<br>Warmly, President of Barista Association
<br></div></div></div><div>Italian</div><div><div>Dear President of Barista Association, 
<br>
<br>Italy! I know that the word espresso means fast in Italian!
<br>How is it? I'm right, aren't I? I would love to drink a cup of espresso at Italy~ 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0},
<br>
<br>Correct! Did you study coffee too? I'd love to try a cup that you brewed ^^
<br>See you at the party. Have a good day ^^
<br>
<br>Warmly, President of Barista Association
<br></div></div></div><div>Spanish</div><div><div>Dear President of Barista Association,
<br>
<br>I drink espressos often...! Spanish! Something tells me that it's Spanish@ 
<br>I'm sure that it's Spanish! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>Wrong! It'd be nice if you know which country the coffee you enjoy comes from. 
<br>I asked about our schedule just now and apparently, I'm getting a delivery of raw coffee beans that day. 
<br>I'll check the beans, roast it... and go if I'm satisfied with the result ^^
<br>
<br>Warmly, President of Barista Association
<br></div></div></div><div>Whatever</div><div><div>Dear President of Barista Association,
<br>
<br>I don't care what that method is~! Coffee's good whatever method you use. You wanna hear my coffee joke?
<br>Why are men like coffee? The best ones are rich, hot, and can keep you up all night!!
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>You obviously don't know anything about coffee...;; And what a vulgar joke. 
<br>I'll go to the party if I mess up the roasting. 
<br>
<br>Best, President of Barista Association
<br></div></div></div><div>Robusta coffee</div><div><div>Dear President of Barista Association,
<br>
<br>The best coffee is robusta coffee! Nothing can beat instant coffee.
<br>That arabica kind is just expensive and it's not as if it tastes so much better~
<br>Robusta or not, pretty much all the same. Right? They just charge you more for it when they taste the same, right?
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>How could not even know the difference between robusta and arabica?
<br>If you love robusta so much, you can serve instant coffee at your party. I'll make sure I'm not there. 
<br>
<br>Best, President of Barista Association

I'm a representative of a modeling agency. I met Zen through work.

<br>
<br>XOXO, Modeling Agency Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>Your face reflected on thy eyes~</div><div><div>Dear Modeling Agency Representative,

<br></div><div> 
<br>Hey {0}, 
<br>
<br>Haha, you are quite amusing. 
<br>Alright, I will take many of our most handsome models to the party.

<br>XOXO, Modeling Agency Representative. 
<br></div></div></div><div>That's not possible for anyone but Zen~</div><div><div>Dear Modeling Agency Representative, 
<br>
<br>You're lying... No matter how good looking you are, that can't happen to anyone but Zen! 
<br>Are you sure your employees aren't secretly breaking your mirrors?

<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Hey {0}, 
<br>
<br>I know that Zen is good looking... but so am I. Sad you don't know that. 
<br>I'll ask my employees about the schedule and see. 
<br>
<br>Take care, Modeling Agency Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>Don't look forward to it.</div><div><div>Dear Modeling Agency Representative, 
<br>
<br>The party hosts are good looking, but I don't know...
<br>I can't be sure that people will be good looking enough to be models. Don't look forward to it so much. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Hey {0}, 
<br>
<br>Really? That's sad to hear...
<br>If there are many handsome people there, we'd be able to take care of more work. 
<br>I'll see if the party will benefit us and decide.

<br>
<br>Hello. I am {0}, the party coordinator. 
<br>You own a oil tanker? That is much more than I expected. Wow!
<br>We have enough parking space to accommodate all the guests and more. You do not have to worry about brining your truck ^^
<br>

<br>
<br>So you like TV shows! We are currently planning many things for the party so that no one gets bored.

<br>From, Oil Prince
<br></div></div></div><div>Bald</div><div><div>Dear Oil Prince, 
<br>
<br>I would chose the bald one! It's not good to judge people by their looks. Even though he's bald, if he has a good heart, I would like him.

Dear Charity Party Representative, 

Hello. We are the Homeless Rescue Team that recuses homeless people who live on the streets. 
I hope more parties like RFA are held so that people in need and rescue teams like us can receive more support. 
Would we be able to meet potential donators at the party? 

All the best, Chief of Homeless Rescue Team 
</div><div>Lots of people with warm hearts!</div><div><div>Dear Chief of Homeless Rescue Team, 
<br>
<br>Hello. I am {0}, the RFA representative. 
<br>We have invited many guests who will appreciate our charity cause and wish to be of help. 
<br>So I'm sure the Homeless Rescue Team will meet many donators who have warm hearts ^^
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Charity Party Representative, 
<br>
<br>That is very good to hear. We've been operating a free lunch truck for the homeless and the expenses were becoming difficult to handle. 
<br>We're operating the truck next week as well, so we have to come up with a menu. Could you give us some recommendations? 
<br>
<br>All the best, Chief of Homeless Rescue Team 
<br></div></div></div><div>Rice, soup, green salad, baked salmon, fried eggs</div><div><div>Dear Chief of Homeless Rescue Team, 
<br>
<br>I think a well-balanced, nutritious meal would be great. Like a meal of warm rice, soup, green salad, baked salmon, and fried eggs. 
<br>I am not an expert so I don't know if the meal is actually nutritious... but I'm sure a healthy and hearty meal will be good!
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Charity Party Representative, 
<br>
<br>I understand what you mean! Since the homeless have a hard time eating proper meals, we are hoping that our truck provides the best meal for them. 
<br>We are also preparing a reintegration program for the homeless. We want to support some sort of commercial activity, and are thinking of what would be good for them to sell...
<br>
<br>Best, Chief of Homeless Rescue Team
<br></div></div></div><div>Selling Small Issue Magazine</div><div><div>Dear Chief of Homeless Rescue Team, 
<br>
<br>How about selling magazines like the Small Issue? The magazine itself is meaningful and you won't be restricted by space. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Charity Party Representative, 
<br>
<br>Thank you! We were facing a block... but now we can go to the party and convince the donators about it  
<br>Thank you for giving us a good opportunity. We will try to help people other than the homeless as well. 
<br>See you at the party. 
<br>
<br>Best, Chief of Homeless Rescue Party
<br></div></div></div><div>Selling random stuff in the subway</div><div><div>Dear Chief of Homeless Rescue Team, 
<br>
<br>How about selling things in the subway? First you gather all the homeless people and teach them how to vocalize so that people in other compartments can hear.  
<br>And you can just get them cheap, random stuff. The buyers won't be able to sue even if the thing doesn't work properly, so I doubt you'll see any loss.  
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Charity Party Representative, 
<br>
<br>It's illegal to sell things in the subway;; It also bothers people;; I wish you'd have put more care into your thoughts. 
<br>I think the party will be a good opportunity. I'll check whether the party doesn't clash with another volunteer event and see. 
<br>
<br>Best, Chief of Homeless Rescue Team
<br></div></div></div><div>Chicken nugget combo?</div><div><div>Dear Chief of Homeless Rescue Team, 
<br>
<br>How about a chicken nugget combo? It's cheap and they can just take it anywhere to eat. 
<br>Well... it might be unhealthy but who cares if it's cheap and makes you full? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Charity Party Representative, 
<br>
<br>No matter how lacking we are in funds, we can't provide a meal like that. 
<br>Our organization tries hard to help the homeless in the best way we can. What you said is very irresponsible. 
<br>The charity party is a good opportunity, but I am shocked at your attitude. We will have to discuss it... 
<br>
<br>Best, Chief of Homeless Rescue Team
<br></div></div></div><div>Don't mess up the party.</div><div><div>Dear Chief of Homeless Rescue Team,
<br>
<br>The party is for charity, but RFA will be deciding where the donations go;;
<br>If you ask everyone around for separate donations, we will receive less so please don't mess up the party by doing that;;
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Charity Party Representative, 
<br>
<br>How could you say that? 
<br>The person who referred us to you was very kind... I am very disappointed.

<br>Oh, it's just girls and boys older than you playing games to drink Soda... Games like Soda Pong.... or Never Have I Ever Drank Soda... things like that. It's good that you slept! They're really boring! 
<br>You might enjoy them if you become maybe 10 years older.
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Hi {0}, 
<br>
<br>Oh... really? Well, smart kids like me don't play such childish games! Hahaha
<br>Mom told me I'd get a girlfriend once I go to college, but none of the girls are talking to me. Why is that? 
<br>
<br>Best, Youngest College Students Representative, 
<br></div></div></div><div>It's because you're too smart.</div><div><div>Hi Youngest College Students Representative, 
<br>
<br>It's because you are so smart. So all the girls just give up trying to talk to you. 
<br>It's their loss~ I'm sure 10 years later... I mean, soon, you'll be the most popular one at school!
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Hi {0}, 
<br>
<br>Haha. So that was it? It was just because I'm too smart! I guess I should have figured it out. 
<br>I can be quite cute though you know. haha
<br>Thanks for the advice, {0}! I want to ask you more questions at the party. See you there!
<br>
<br>Best, Youngest College Students Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>Because you're a baby</div><div><div>
<br>Hi Youngest College Students Representative, 
<br>Oh come one. Why would the girls talk to someone so little? 
<br>You need to grow way older, kid! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Hi {0}, 
<br>
<br>I'm still smart enough to get into college! 
<br>I can talk about college life too... T_T
<br>I'll ask mom about the party and go if she says yes. 
<br>
<br>Best, Youngest College Students Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>You don't need to know.</div><div><div>
<br>Hi Youngest College Students Representative, 
<br>You don't need to know, kid~ How would you ever understand what adults do!
<br>
<br>I bet all the frat guys had a hard time babysitting you! 
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Hi {0}, 
<br>
<br>I hate people ignoring me because I'm younger! 
<br>Everyone keeps telling me I'm not old enough to understand adult business! They're dumber than me! Hmph!
<br>I'm not going to go to the party and do what I want! 
<br>
<br>-Youngest College Students Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>There's this person called Yoosung.</div><div><div>Hi Youngest College Students Representative,
<br>
<br>Hi, sweetie! I'm {0}, and I'm the party coordinator! 
<br>One of the hosts for this party is called Yoosung and he's a college student too! 
<br>
<br>Although he never goes to school and plays games all day and all night! I'm sure you two can get along. 
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Hi {0}, 
<br>
<br>Only kids my age play games! I'm an adult since I'm in college so I don't play games!
<br>I asked for someone who I can have an intelligent conversation with, not someone who just plays games! 
<br>Hmph! I don't want to go to a party hosted by someone like that!

My dear Lady, 

Greetings. Let me introduce myself. I am the Lady of the Workbaskets. 
I have been reached by a man called Seven Oh Seven, who has graciously told me to send my greetings to you. 
I have been informed about this feast... But, unfortunately, I am very occupied with work and cannot focus on sending electronic posts... 
If you could kindly aid me in solving this conundrum, we can proceed to discuss the feast. 
I would be honored if you could select a thread color that would compliment green fabric. 

Your humble servant, Lady of the Workbaskets
</div><div>Green</div><div><div>Dear Lady of the Workbaskets, 
<br>
<br>How do you do? I am {0}, the messenger for the feast. 
<br>If I dare to give you my opinion, I suggest green. I think it will blend very well with the fabric. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>Green
<br>My dear Lady {0},
<br>
<br>How do you do, my sweet lady {0}? Per your suggestion, I tried using green and it was very natural. 
<br>Thanks to you, I was able to finish my work very quickly. I thank you very much.
<br>My lady, you seem to be greatly knowledgable of hand crafts. Might I ask how long you have practiced your craft?
<br>
<br>Your humble servant, Lady of the Workbaskets
<br></div></div></div><div>Long enough to do well with my eyes closed!</div><div><div>Dear Lady of the Workbaskets, 
<br>
<br>I am ashamed to tell you. My skills are still very poor and I am afraid I can never be called a master...
<br>But I have practiced long enough to create a proper basket with my eyes closed. Of course, compared to yours, it is terrible. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>My dear Lady {0},
<br>
<br>I hope this finds you well. You must be greatly skilled to produce a basket with your eyes closed. I very much would like to meet you. 
<br>Since you appear to be very familiar with hand crafts and sewing...
<br>I do not mean to brag, but I have been sewing long enough to have tried almost everything. 
<br>So I would like to take on a new challenge... Do you have any recommendations, my lady?
<br>
<br>Your humble servant, Lady of the Workbaskets
<br></div></div></div><div>Get a camel through the eye of a needle.</div><div><div>Dear Lady of the Workbaskets, 
<br>
<br>My dear sir, why don't you attempt to get something other than a thread through the eye of a needle...?
<br>I am certain that no one in this world has succeeded in getting a camel through the eye of a needle!
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>My dear Lady {0},
<br>
<br>Taking on the challenge of an idiom, getting a camel through the eye of a needle...
<br>This has never occurred to me! My lady, what a great idea!
<br>You have given me a new goal in my humble life. 
<br>I will make sure to attend the party. I will give you my proper greetings in person there. 
<br>
<br>Your humble servant, Lady of the Workbaskets
<br></div></div></div><div>Use a needle threader.</div><div><div>Dear Lady of the Workbaskets, 
<br>
<br>Why don't you try using a tool you have never used so far, my lady?
<br>If you use a needle threader, you can save energy and time.
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>My dear Lady {0},
<br>
<br>Thank you for your recommendation...
<br>But for 15 years, I have sewed without the help of any tool, and I have no plans to change that. 
<br>I will attend the feast if my current project ends before then.
<br>
<br>Your humble servant, Lady of the Workbaskets
<br></div></div></div><div>Use a sewing machine.</div><div><div>Dear Lady of the Workbaskets, 
<br>
<br>How do you do, my lady? To be honest, my hands are not skilled so I use a sewing machine. 
<br>Although it lacks human touch, the machine is very fast and more exact. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>My dear Lady {0},
<br>
<br>So you use a sewing machine... You selected a very nice color for me 
<br>so I had assumed we would be able to share an in-depth conversation about sewing...
<br>I will have to further consider attending the party. 
<br>
<br>Your humble servant, Lady of the Workbaskets
<br></div></div></div><div>Red</div><div><div>Dear Lady of the Workbaskets, 
<br>
<br>How do you do? I am {0}, the messenger for the feast. 
<br>How about red? The color contrast will be stark and the thread will be very noticeable!
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>My dear Lady {0},
<br>
<br>Per your recommendation, I tried using red... But the color was too strong and ruined the original aura of the fabric. I had to redo the whole work. 
<br>Thanks to that, I have more work to finish and cannot attend the party. 
<br>Then a good day to you.
<br>
<br>Your humble servant, Lady of the Workbaskets

Dear RFA Representative,

Hello, I am the president of the Meteor Study Club. We study everything regarding meteorites and stars☆☆.
To be honest, I thought Yoosung contacted me to say that he would like to join the club. 
I am sad that was not the case, but I hope to find someone who shines bright just like a star at your party. 
What do you think of when you gaze at the beautiful stars on the night sky?☆☆

Love the stars, President of Meteor Study Club ☆☆
</div><div>Memories of my first kiss ☆</div><div><div>Dear President of Meteor Study Club, 
<br>
<br>Hello. I am ☆{0}☆, the RFA representative. 
<br>I heard that your club scouts people for interesting reasons. I hope you find many friends at the party!
<br>When I look at the stars on the night sky, I can't help but reminisce on my first kiss! ☆>///<☆
<br>
<br>Best, ☆{0}☆
<br></div><div> 
<br>Dear ☆{0}☆,
<br>
<br>Then I am sure the night sky always shines with beautiful memories for you. ☆ 
<br>Then what do you think about the round and charming moon by their side? 
<br>
<br>Love the stars, President of Meteor Study Club ☆☆
<br></div></div></div><div>I want to eat it!</div><div><div>Dear President of Meteor Study Club ☆, 
<br>
<br>When I look at the full moon, I get hungry T_T
<br>The round shape reminds me of a bagel, or pizza, or cheese... I get really hungry! 
<br>
<br>Best, ☆{0}☆
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear ☆{0}☆,
<br>
<br>I think so too! I can't help but salivate when I look at the moon through my telescope. 
<br>Then how about meteorites? What do you think when you look at meteorites falling from the sky?
<br>
<br>Love the stars, President of Meteor Study Club ☆☆
<br></div></div></div><div>I have to make a wish!</div><div><div>Dear President of Meteor Study Club ☆, 
<br>
<br>People say that if you wish upon a shooting star, it comes true. They're rare but when I see them, I always make a wish ><
<br>Then I'm sure the meteor takes my wish and leaves to make it come true. ☆ If I see a shooting star this time, I'll wish for many people to show up at the party!  
<br>
<br>Best, ☆{0}☆
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear ☆{0}☆,
<br>
<br>Your fun stories are embroidering the night sky. It is so beautiful. 
<br>And it seems that your wish has come true. The meteor is leading me to the party. ☆ See you there. ☆ 
<br>
<br>Love the stars, President of Meteor Study Club ☆☆
<br></div></div></div><div>I calculate whether or not I can go pick up the meteor!</div><div><div>Dear President of Meteor Study Club ☆, 
<br>
<br>The moment the meteor reaches the Earth's atmosphere, it's important whether or not it falls to the ground. 
<br>Since some sell for a high price, I always calculate whether or not I can go find one!
<br>
<br>Best, ☆{0}☆
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear ☆{0}☆,
<br>
<br>Although meteors are very important for the study of stars... that sounds too practical T_T
<br>I had my hopes up since you had very pretty stories with stars and the moon... I will attend the party if a meteor doesn't fall the day before. 
<br>
<br>Love the stars, President of Meteor Study Club ☆☆
<br></div></div></div><div>I calculate the harvest calendar!</div><div><div>Dear President of Meteor Study Club ☆, 
<br>
<br>It's said that people of the old times distinguished seasons according to the shape of the moon and harvested accordingly. 
<br>I look at the night sky and think what time this is perfect for. 
<br>
<br>Best, ☆{0}☆
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear ☆{0}☆,
<br>
<br>Actually, it is not the moon but the sun that is closely related to seasons. Of course, the moon does help in figuring out the sowing and harvest season...
<br>I will attend the party if I go to bed early after observing the night sky the day before. 
<br>
<br>Love the stars, President of Meteor Study Club ☆☆
<br></div></div></div><div>I calculate the star's life span.</div><div><div>Dear President of Meteor Study Club,
<br>
<br>I observe the color of the stars and calculate their life spans. 
<br>I'm sure that you do this often as the president of the meteor club. You're not one of those people who look at the stars and think there are rabbits living there, do you?
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>We can easily calculate such things, but I actually wanted to hear a more beautiful answer. T_T☆
<br>You've put a veil over bright thoughts and emotions... I'd rather look at the night sky and listen to beautiful stories than attend the party.
<br>Love the stars, President of Meteor Study Club

<br>Cats are very clean creatures so they clean themselves up, and you don't have to potty train them meow.

Dear Banquet Representative, 

Hahahahaha. I am the officer of LOLOL's best guild. 
I was contacted by Guild Master Shooting Star to send you an email. 
A banquet, that sounds very pleasing... I would like to discuss with my other guild members but communication is not very easy.
Why don't you recommend me a mic to use for game voice chatting? 

Be well, LOLOL Guild Officer
</div><div>Headset</div><div><div>Dear Guild Officer, 
<br>
<br>Sup Guild Officer! I'm {0}. 
<br>How about a headset? A lot of pro gamers use it and it is very convenient to use!

<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div> 
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>Hello. This is the LOLOL Guild Officer. 
<br>Thank you so much for recommending a headset. I discussed it with the guild members and we will be purchasing one each. 
<br>We are currently discussing how to build masteries within the guild. 
<br>If you are acquainted with Guild Master Shooting Star, I'm sure you are familiar with LOLOL. 
<br>Could you spare us some time and help us decide which skill tree to choose?
<br>
<br>Be well, LOLOL Guild Officer
<br></div></div></div><div>Focus on balance</div><div><div>Dear LOLOL Guild Officer, 
<br>
<br>Hello! You sound way more polite in this email! haha. 
<br>I would make sure the tree is balanced. Since I'll be able to react to any situation!
<br>
<br>Best, {0} 
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Banquet Representative, 
<br>
<br>Hahahaha! It was because I was at my office! My boss was behind me so I had to pretend I was sending a business email. 
<br>So you think the same. Yes, balance is the most basic and most important. Right you are! 
<br>Why don't you talk to Guild Master Shooting Star and join our guild? 
<br>And since we're talking about our guild, we are thinking of changing the name... Can you suggest a fierce name? 
<br>
<br>Be well, LOLOL Guild Officer
<br></div></div></div><div>Blood Dragon</div><div><div>Hi LOLOL Guild Officer,
<br>
<br>The name blood dragon! Doesn't anythings sound fierce if you put blood in front of it? 
<br>
<br>-{0} 
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>Blood Dragon... The guild members love it!!!! 
<br>All the members wish to join the banquet. 
<br>I will meet you in person then and show my gratitude! 
<br>
<br>-LOLOL Guild Officer
<br></div></div></div><div>J Beaver</div><div><div>Dear LOLOL Guild Officer,
<br>
<br>How about J Beaver? BJ for short! 
<br>I think this name suits you and Shooting Start too.
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0},
<br>
<br>J Beaver...? I can only think of that male singer...
<br>You seem to have no talent in creating names...
<br>I will take a vote concerning the banquet and tell you the result. 
<br>
<br>-LOLOL Guild Officer
<br></div></div></div><div>Christmas Tree</div><div><div>Dear LOLOL Guild Officer, 
<br>
<br>Hello lolololol. You seem way more polite lololol
<br>Skill tree? If you're talking about trees, I only know about Christmas trees. 
<br>Do you build Christmas tress inside the game? 
<br>
<br>-{0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>My boss was standing behind me when I was writing the email. 
<br>I thought you knew better about LOLOL... but I suppose you are a noob. 
<br>I will discuss with the members concerning the banquet and decide whether or not to attend. 
<br>
<br>-LOLOL Guild Officer,
<br></div></div></div><div>Karaoke mic</div><div><div>Dear LOLOL Guild Officer, 
<br>
<br>Hey! I'm {0}, the party guest coordinator. 
<br>I'm sure a karaoke mike is best for voice chatting! The voice will be loud and clear!
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Hello {0},
<br>Hi. 
<br>
<br>Since playing games requires both hands, one can not a hold a mic. 
<br>And getting a mic stand will only interfere with the gameplay. Unfortunately, because we cannot use voice chatting,
<br>it will be difficult for our guild members to discuss concerning the party. And I cannot make the decision by myself.

<br>Hello, I am {0}, the RFA party coordinator.
<br>If you are even creating a new business card for the party, I must make sure to prepare better!
<br>I think a golf ball shape would be too plain... How about a driver? Anyone will recognize that it's a golf company! 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Nice shot! Young people are indeed different. I must make an order right now. 
<br>You know when you have to hit a ball near the water... sometimes you have to step inside the water with your shoes on. 
<br>That makes me very uncomfortable so I want to have my men create something that can prevent the discomfort. You must have another idea related to this in that young brain of yours?
<br>
<br>-President of Golf Clothing Company
<br></div></div></div><div>Shoes that dry quickly.</div><div><div>Dear President of Golf Clothing Company,
<br>
<br>I think rain boots will be more discomforting... and you can't avoid getting wet... How about shoes made of material that dry fast even though they get wet?
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>NICE SHOT! Since my employees will be the ones actually creating it, they'll take care of it on their own. 
<br>I should have them create a new type of gloves as well. They get worn out and the golf club tends to slip...
<br>Since you're young... you know what I'm saying I hope?
<br>
<br>-President of Golf Clothing Company
<br></div></div></div><div>Leather that does not wear out.</div><div><div>Dear President of Golf Clothing Company,
<br>
<br>If the problem is that the gloves wear out, what about making sure they don't? Sales will increase dramatically if your company can create a material like that! 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Whole in one!!! You are a very smart lady. I wish my employees were like you. 
<br>I very much look forward to seeing how my development team executes your idea. 
<br>I will give you my card when I get to the party. Then see you then. 
<br>
<br>-President of Golf Clothing Company
<br></div></div></div><div>Dragon leather.</div><div><div>Dear President of Golf Clothing Company,
<br>
<br>Make the gloves out of fantastic dragon leather! They say dragon leather is very durable! 
<br>Just tell your employees to research on dinosaurs and take it from there! How about it? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Did you hit your head somewhere? Don't be silly.
<br>Dragons don't exist. 
<br>But your previous idea was good so I'll take that into account. But this one is ridiculous. 
<br>I'll think more about going to the party. 
<br>
<br>-President of Golf Clothing Company
<br></div></div></div><div>Rocket shoes.</div><div><div>Dear President of Golf Clothing Company,
<br>
<br>How about rocket shoes? You can float on water and hit the ball! You won't get wet and it'll be easier to get to other holes! 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Tsk tsk... You are very naive, I assume. 
<br>I think I am to play golf with someone that day... I'll go there. Perhaps I should cancel my business card. 
<br>
<br>-President of Golf Clothing Company
<br></div></div></div><div>How about a ladle shape?</div><div><div>Dear President of Golf Clothing Company,
<br>
<br>Hello. I am {0}, theRFA Party Coordinator.
<br>Hmm~ Since drivers look like ladles, how about a ladle shaped logo? It will feel more friendly than a golf club! 
<br>Isn't it pretty original? I'm sure this is the idea you wanted to hear! 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Well, I won't even need to make a new business card now! 
<br>A ladle...? Are you saying that people should start eating with golf clubs now? 
<br>How silly. I'll forget about the party. 
<br>

Dear Party Guest Coordinator, 

Haha! I'm a huge fan of floppy disks! 
I think it was 70...8? Someone talked to us about the party! We collect all the floppy disks in the world! 
How old I am to collect such a thing? Shh! Don't ask! We just collect memories! haha
We want to make some merchandise celebrating floppy disks. What do you think we should make? 

Best wishes, Floppy Disk Mania 
</div><div>A rainbow colored floppy disk model.</div><div><div>Dear Floppy Disk Mania, 
<br>
<br>Hello! I'm {0}, the party guest coordinator! 
<br>You collect memories? What a nice way to put it! How about a rainbow colored floppy disk model? 
<br>Red, orange, yellow... There may be one of each color, but I've never seen a rainbow colored one before!
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Party Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Haha! I suppose it's one of floppy disk's appeal that there are a lot of colors! Alright, it's sad that it's only a model, but we'll make them! 
<br>To be honest, hardly any companies manufacture floppy disks now... Have you seen a floppy disk recently? 
<br>
<br>Best wishes, Floppy Disk Mania 
<br></div></div></div><div>Windows 8.1 3711 disks.</div><div><div>Dear Floppy Disk Mania, 
<br>
<br>I haven't seen one myself... but while I was surfing the net, I came across a photo of 3711 floppy disks that all together contain one Windows 8.1 installation file! 
<br>Just thinking about it shocks me;;; How long do you think it would take to install the software? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Party Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>3711 disks?! That many disks came out into the world? OMG! I will have to collect them!!! 
<br>But there's another famous collector aside from me these days... the Cassette Mania!!! 
<br>I would really like to beat him. What should I do? 
<br>
<br>Best wishes, Floppy Disk Mania 
<br></div></div></div><div>Obtain a limited edition cassette tape and hide it.</div><div><div>Dear Floppy Disk Mania, 
<br>
<br>You should obtain a limited edition cassette tape and hide it! He'll be so busy looking for that limited edition.
<br>Meanwhile, you can focus right on finding floppy disks. How about it? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Party Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Haha! Good idea~~~! I'll finally show him who's boss now!!!
<br>Alright. I'll record the conversations of famous people at RFA and create a limited edition cassette tape. 
<br>If you keep quiet about that, I can show you my rare floppy disks in return. 
<br>Then see you at the party!
<br>
<br>Best wishes, Floppy Disk Mania 
<br></div></div></div><div>Break his walkman!</div><div><div>
<br>Dear Floppy Disk Mania, 
<br>Why don't you break his walkman? 
<br>Even if he finds cassettes, it's useless if you don't have a player. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Party Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Whoah... Calm down! No matter how jealous I get, it's too cruel to destroy a collectible! 
<br>I can't do that... I should just focus on collecting my disks! 
<br>There a disk auction the day before the party. If my schedule doesn't get mixed up, I'll go! 
<br>
<br>Best wishes, Floppy Disk Mania 
<br></div></div></div><div>It's only in my memories.</div><div><div>Dear Floppy Disk Mania, 
<br>
<br>Who uses a floppy disk these days? Computers that come out these days don't even have a slot. 
<br>It's only in my memories....
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div> 
<br>Dear Party Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>I need more information.... I need something new...
<br>I have to leave the country to find more information. I'll attend the party if I return before then!

<br></div></div></div><div>Magnet bracelet</div><div><div>Dear Floppy Disk Mania, 
<br>
<br>Hello! I'm {0}, the party guest coordinator. 
<br>How about a magnet bracelet? You can put a nice logo, and make it so people can freely adjust the size! 
<br>It can be a cool fashion item, so I recommend the magnet bracelet!
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>

<br>Magnet!?!?!?!?!?!? How could you even think to put a magnet near a floppy disk!? 
<br>Then all the data will get destroyed!! You're an enemy to the disks!!

Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 

Hello. I am the president of the Doctors With Conscience Organization. 
I heard from Zen that this is a charity party. I think it is for a good cause. 
Our organization attempts to follow our conscience while treating patients. Are you aware of the oath that doctors must make regarding their ethics? 

Sincerely, President of Doctors With Conscience
</div><div>Hippocratic oath.</div><div><div>Dear President of Doctors With Conscience, 
<br>
<br>Hello, I am {0}, RFA's party guest coordinator! I will also try my best to hold a honest party. 
<br>The oath was written by Hippocrates, who's called the father of medicine. I heard that you have to make the oath when you graduate from med school! 
<br>I know it to contain an oath about valuing the patient's health more than your own benefits. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>You are right. These are some of the words: "I will take care that they suffer no hurt or damage." "Whatsoever house I may enter, my visit shall be for the convenience and advantage of the patient."
<br>But I've heard that some doctors these days treat the patients excessively and unnecessarily... 
<br>Do you know how to avoid becoming a victim to such an ethical wrongdoing? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, President of Doctors With Conscience
<br></div></div></div><div>Request exam results.</div><div><div>Dear President of Doctors With Conscience, 
<br>
<br>I heard that it's best to ask the doctors to write down the exam results, and compare them! 
<br>You have to know your condition in order to select which treatment might be best. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>You know very well. I'm sure you won't become a victim to such horrid doctors. 
<br>Then do you know how to select the best hospital when seeking treatment? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, President of Doctors With Conscience
<br></div></div></div><div>Comparing several hospitals.</div><div><div>Dear President of Doctors With Conscience, 
<br>
<br>You can't select a hospital just because it is big or has a lot of patients. You have to compare several hospitals and select based on expertise. 
<br>Of course, while comparing the exam results you received! That's what I heard. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>If everyone acts like you, they will be treated by doctors who follow their conscience. 
<br>We plan to continue our efforts to keep our conscience as well. 
<br>I am very looking forward to the charity party. Then see you there. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, President of Doctors With Conscience
<br></div></div></div><div>Go to a big hospital near your house.</div><div><div>Dear President of Doctors With Conscience, 
<br>
<br>I guess you can just go to a big hospital near your house? 
<br>It's big and a lot of patients are in line, so I'm sure it's a good hospital. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>You cannot say a hospital is good just because it is big and has a lot of patients. 
<br>There may be unkind doctors and it can lack expertise. 
<br>I will attend the party if I am not scheduled for a surgery. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, President of Doctors With Conscience
<br></div></div></div><div>Just trust the doctors and leave it to them.</div><div><div>Dear President of Doctors With Conscience, 
<br>
<br>To be honest, I've never doubted my doctors. 
<br>I just think that if I trust them and leave everything to them, they'll do a good job. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>That would be possible if all doctors followed their conscience. 
<br>However, many doctors forget the Hippocratic oath and use unnecessary treatments.. Instead of having absolute trust, you must make a habit out of rechecking everything yourself.  
<br>I am scheduled for a surgery on the day of the party and it may take long. I will attend depending on my schedule then. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, President of Doctors With Conscience
<br></div></div></div><div>Schweitzer oath.</div><div><div>Dear President of Doctors With Conscience, 
<br>
<br>I know!! The name takes after a doctor! 
<br>I think... Schweitzer? He was an amazing doctor. Everyone should learn from him. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Albert Schweitzer was a great doctor and also a great philanthropist, but there is no Schweitzer oath. 
<br>About the party, I'm sorry I have to say this, but I am scheduled for a surgery that day. We value our patients the most. 
<br>So we cannot attend, but I hope the party goes well. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, President of Doctors With Conscience

Hello. I am the representative for the group Commercial Musical Supporters. Haha ♪ 
We are a group of people who wish for the commercial musical theater industry to bloom. 
Jaehee Kang introduced us to the party, and she told us a lot of people will be gathered. 
We also pay a great deal of attention to musical theater actors as well as actual productions. Can you introduce a good actor to us? ♪

Very truly yours, Commercial Musical Supporters Representative
</div><div>Zen</div><div><div>Dear Commercial Musical Supporters Representative,
<br>
<br>Hello, I am {0}, RFA's representative. If you are searching for a good musical theater actor, I recommend Zen who is also a member of the RFA. 
<br>He not only has good looks but also great acting skills, as well as a good voice. He's also a fantastic piano player! 
<br>He's never been on TV but he has a considerable fan base. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}

<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>Of course we know Zen! We've seen a couple of his shows as well. I know that he has considerable ticket power. ♪
<br>But I remember that he has always played pretty boys so far... Can we see him in a different kind of role?
<br>
<br>Very truly yours, Commercial Musical Supporters Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>This production of "The Red Pepper Was So Hot"</div><div><div>Dear Commercial Musical Supporters Representative,
<br>
<br>Zen is trying to take more manly characters now. 
<br>If the musical "The Jalapeno Topping Was Pretty Spicy" just had a promiscuous poster but a bland story...
<br>his new role is literally "hot" like a "red pepper". You'll be surprised at how excited the show will make you!  
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>Oh my!! Red... pepper...!♪♪♪♪♪♪
<br>That makes me very excited!! I must make sure to see the show. 
<br>But... I'll have to succeed in getting a ticket... It's so difficult to get a seat...
<br>How can you succeed in getting a ticket for a show that stars a popular actor?♪
<br>
<br>Very truly yours, Commercial Musical Supporters Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>Get the help of college students.</div><div><div>Dear Commercial Musical Supporters Representative,
<br>
<br>How about getting help from college students? They're used to competing to register for their classes! I'm sure they can be your ticketing soldiers!

<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>Ticketing soldiers!♪♪  Well, if even college students help us then we have a much better chance! I should gather some students who have free time! ♪♪ 
<br>I'd like to go to the party and ask in detail what kind of role Zen is preparing for. 
<br>If he is headed towards a good direction, we will give him our full support! ♪♪ 
<br>Thank you for the good advice. Then see you at the party! 
<br>
<br>Very truly yours, Commercial Musical Supporters Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>Ask an acquaintance who works in theater.</div><div><div>
<br>If you are in a supporter group, I'm sure you are acquainted with theater companies. Or even the actors. 
<br>Can't you just ask them for the tickets? Even if you have to pay them a bit, all's good if you get the tickets, no?
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>No, we do not want to rely on such methods. Using bribe money or buying tickets from the black market 
<br>only deters the commercial musical theater industry from growing. How could you tell us to do such a thing... 
<br>I'll see if there aren't any shows that day and think about it!
<br>
<br>Very truly yours, Commercial Musical Supporters Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>Zen is good as he is.</div><div><div>Dear Commercial Musical Supporters Representative,
<br>
<br>To be honest, I think that Zen should keep his current image. 
<br>He has been playing pretty boys all the time, but it's good to become an expert in one area. Wouldn't that be easier on Zen? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>We are aware that Zen is very good at playing such characters. I'm sure he'll continue to be great. 
<br>But we'd like to see him play a new type of character. A good actor should portray various types of people and emotions. 
<br>You seem to have a different perspective than ours. 
<br>We have to go search for new actors so I don't know if we can make it. 
<br>

<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative,

Hello. I am from the Independent Games Organization. 
We are not very mainstream, so we were pleasantly surprised that Yoosung invited us. haha
I have quite a beer belly right now from all the red bull I drank while working late, so I'm worried whether we can show up. haha
Also since we haven't found a place to upload our game, we wouldn't really know what to say to people we newly meet. 
Do you know any place we can upload our indie games? 

Best, Indie Games Representative
</div><div>How about Scheam?</div><div><div>Dear Indie Games Representative, 
<br>
<br>Hello! I'm {0}, RFA's representative. 
<br>How about Scheam? The site offers major games, but a lot of indie games are actively sold there! 
<br>You can sell the game without a publisher and receive player feedbacks through green light!
<br>If you receive a lot of votes, Scheam will sell the game officially. So I think this is a good place!
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0},
<br>
<br>Scheam...! Yes, of course. To be honest, that was the first platform we thought of, but we didn't have enough courage. 
<br>Still, if that's the first place you thought of, I'm sure we shouldn't avoid it at least. 
<br>Alright. We'll have to work on it more and aim to upload it on Steam. My work hours will get longer of course... 
<br>Do you know any games we can benchmark? 
<br>
<br>Best, Indie Games Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>Nameless.</div><div><div>Dear Indie Games Representative, 
<br>
<br>Do you know the game Nameless? Online or mobile games are more common these days, but this is a PC game. Moreover, it's very unique in that it caters to a female audience! 
<br>Won't it help you better analyze how female players think? It was even greenlit on Scheam! I think it will be a great game to benchmark. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0},
<br>
<br>Actually, most members of our organization are men, so we never had a clue about what kind of games women like. 
<br>So I'll make sure to check it out. We should start coming up with marketing ideas, but I'm pathetic at anything other than developing games. What should I do?
<br>
<br>Best, Indie Games Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>Why don't you participate in a game convention?</div><div><div>Dear Indie Games Representative, 
<br>
<br>Why don't you try putting out a small booth at a game convention and explain the game yourself to the people there and let them try playing?
<br>There will be a lot of gamers and newspapers there, so you can get a lot of exposure! I think it's a great way to advertise your games. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0},
<br>
<br>I looked up game conventions as soon as I read your email. I found one that opens just when we are expected to finish developing our next game! 
<br>I ordered two more boxes of red bull so that we can meet the deadline for the game convention! haha
<br>Even if we're very busy with developing the game, we'll make sure to leave the party day empty. See you then!

<br>
<br>What? You want me to sneak it? That's a bit reckless;; What if I get caught?

<br>Dear Indie Games Representative, 
<br>How about LOLOL? It's super popular to students these days! 
<br>Of course, it has a lot of system and graphic requirements so you'll have to have a good computer. I think 1000 or so people were involved in making LOLOL? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0},
<br>
<br>We are an organization of indie game developers. We almost all work in one-man or small companies, so it's difficult to create such a high quality game... 
<br>I'm sure it's fun, but I hoped you'd recommend a game that would fit our situation. I should have used the time to look it up myself.

<br>There are still so many cats that live on the streets. I hope those kiddos come to the shelter and stay in a good environment. But it saddens me to see that so many of them are very traumatized... 
<br>They run away as soon as you reach out for them...
<br>
<br>Peace and Love, Head of Cat Shelter
<br></div></div></div><div>Give them food and wait.</div><div><div>Dear Head of Cat Shelter, 
<br>
<br>It could be dangerous to take them away by force. The mom can abandon the kitten... Or it might attack you in fear T_T
<br>I think it's best to first provide them food and wait until they open up. Wait and see, I think that is the first step we have to take. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}

<br>You are right. We shouldn't rush them just because we want to. (TAT) 
<br>I want to let more people know about cat adoption so that the cats that come to our shelter find a loving family. Can you think of a good way to do this? 
<br>
<br>Peace and Love, Head of Cat Shelter
<br></div></div></div><div>Social media sites.</div><div><div>Dear Head of Cat Shelter, 
<br>
<br>Why don't you advertise it on social media sites? Many people will see it, and the feedback will be instant. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0} 
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>I'm not really familiar with social media, but I should create an account right now! (OAO)!! Of course, we'll be very careful with the actual adoption process.  
<br>It would be great if we could meet more generous people like you. 
<br>Then see you at the party. Toodle-loo! 
<br>
<br>Peace and Love, Head of Cat Shelter
<br></div></div></div><div>Call people you know!</div><div><div>Dear Head of Cat Shelter, 
<br>
<br>I'm sure many around us love cats. You should call them and convince them to take the cat! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0} 
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>There are many things to consider when adopting a cat. Both the cat and the adopter will have a hard time if I just throw it on them. 
<br>I'll think of a better way to advertise it. (OAT)  
<br>I'll see how the cats are doing and decide then. Have a good day! 
<br>
<br>Peace and Love, Head of Cat Shelter
<br></div></div></div><div>Pet them and share your feelings.</div><div><div>Dear Head of Cat Shelter, 
<br>
<br>Just like people communicate best through touch, I'm sure if you pet them they'll feel your love!
<br>Sneak towards them, hug them, and rub your face on them~! The'll feel the love for sure! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0} 
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>Oh no, the kiddos will be very surprised (OAO);;! I think that's a very violent way to approach cats...
<br>I would rather wait for them to open up even if that takes longer...
<br>I'm supposed to go feed street cats that day. If they seem to be doing fine, I'll go to the party afterwards. 
<br>
<br>Peace and Love, Head of Cat Shelter
<br></div></div></div><div>To be honest...</div><div><div>Dear Head of Cat Shelter, 
<br>
<br>Hello, I'm {0}, the RFA representative. 
<br>To be honest, I don't know if anyone other than Jumin there will like cats. 
<br>I know for sure that some of the guests hate cats. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0} 
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>(OAO)(OAO)!! I suppose it's not a good place for us to seek help...
<br>Then we'll just stay at the shelter and take care of our cats. 
<br>
<br>Peace and Love, Head of Cat Shelter

<br>Dear Party Representative, 
<br>
<br>Nah. I'm good. I don't care about anything that's not related to Zen♡. Everyone except him is fugly!!

Dear RFA Party Representative, 

Hello, I am the Head of Keyboard Research Facility. 
All our researchers were very surprised after being asked if we are interested in this party. 
We are currently pulling several all nighters to develop keyboards of the gamers, by the gamers, for the gamers.
Do you know what the most important factor is in developing a comfortable keyboard? 

Sincerely, Head of Keyboard Research Facility
</div><div>Ergonomics.</div><div><div>Dear Head of Keyboard Research Facility,
<br>
<br>Hello! I'm {0}, RFA's party guest coordinator. 
<br>I think it's ergonomics. I've read an article that said a curved keyboard is best for the human wrist!
<br>My wrists tend to hurt whenever I spend a long time typing T_T
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party Representative, 
<br>
<br>Ergonomics, you are correct. It is very important to gamers who spend a long time playing. 
<br>The shape of keyboards are customized for the human physique so that even if one has to type for long, the wrist is less burdened. 
<br>We are trying to add short keys to the one currently in development for maximized comfort. 
<br>We want to simplify the short keys for cut and paste jobs. Do you know what the standard short keys are for that? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Head of Keyboard Research Facility
<br></div></div></div><div>ctrl+c</div><div><div>Dear Head of Keyboard Research Facility,
<br>
<br>Control+c!!! Control+v!!! You use these keys several times a day! 
<br>It would be so convenient if all I have to press is one key! I'll be looking forward to it! 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party Representative, 
<br>
<br>We will work harder to meet your anticipation. 
<br>Next month, we plan to launch the keyboard M.O.V.I83 made exclusively for mobile games, so please take interest in that as well. 
<br>Why don't you give us a nickname for the keyboard? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Head of Keyboard Research Facility
<br></div></div></div><div>Movi</div><div><div>Dear Head of Keyboard Research Facility,
<br>
<br>M.O.V.I83... Why don't you just use Movi? The keyboard Movi for mobile games! It has a ring to it, doesn't it? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party Representative, 
<br>
<br>"Movi"... That's very friendly and familiar. We may be good researchers, but we're horrible at coming up with names. 
<br>You helped me better understand how actual users feel. 
<br>Thank you. See you at the party. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Head of Keyboard Research Facility
<br></div></div></div><div>Cutie Pie 83.</div><div><div>
<br>Dear Head of Keyboard Research Facility,
<br>How about Cutie Pie 83? It's a really friendly and casual name!!
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party Representative, 
<br>
<br>Well... I'd be embarrassed if the newspapers call our keyboard Cutie Pie 83...
<br>I'd feel weird hearing "Cutie Pie 83 got broken!", so we'll think about it further...
<br>We'll try to adjust our schedule for the party during the meeting. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Head of Keyboard Research Facility
<br></div></div></div><div>Control+V!</div><div><div>
<br>Control V! control+V is copy and control+C is paste, right? 
<br>I use this at least a hundred times every day~
<br>
<br>Dear Head of Keyboard Research Facility,
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party Representative, 
<br>
<br>It's the opposite... Control+C is copy and Control+V is paste. 
<br>If you've used it that often, I'm curious of what kind of documents who wrote. 
<br>Our schedule is getting delayed, so I can't confirm whether we'll go to the party. Sorry.
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Head of Keyboard Research Facility
<br></div></div></div><div>Color</div><div><div>Dear Head of Keyboard Research Facility,
<br>
<br>Hello! I'm {0}, RFA's party guest coordinator.
<br>Hmm... I think it's color! I saw a rainbow-colored keyboard online a couple days ago and it was gorgeous! 
<br>I use it everyday. It should at least be pretty! 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party Representative, 
<br>
<br>Visual appeal is important but to be honest, gamers do not pay much attention to that aspect. 
<br>When I sent you my last email, I thought we'd be able to attend, but our schedule has changed and we can't go. 
<br>I hope the party is a success. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Head of Keyboard Research Facility

<div>
It is ridiculous that low-quality films are filling up slots for film festivals through the power of money. 

And it is also ridiculous that a great film cannot go up on the big screen because it lacks funds. 
...I apologize. I didn't even introduce myself. Hello. I am the Vice President of the Fair Film Festival Committee. I will be in contact with you concerning the party. 
As I just mentioned, we wish to screen films that are simply well made regardless of their funds. We often find hidden gems amongst indie films. 
At our last film festival, the film "Boyhoodie" was the center of attention. Do you know that film??

-VP of Fair Film Festival Committee
</div><div>A film about the environment</div><div><div>Hello! I'm {0}, the RFA party guest coordinator. 
<br>
<br>I haven't seen it myself, but I know the film "Boyhoodie". It's a movie about how a boy and his family grows up. 
<br>I heard it was filmed for 12 years with the same cast, and draws an insightful and true-to-life portrayal of childhood and family love.   
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>I am sorry you missed the chance to see it. I will try harder to make sure good films are screen outside of the festival. 
<br>There are many TV documentaries that are terrific and I would love to adapt to the big screen. What do you think is most important for documentaries? 
<br>
<br>-VP of Fair Film Festival Committee
<br></div></div></div><div>Realism</div><div><div>Dear VP of Fair Film Festival Committee,
<br>
<br>Documentaries are considered as records, and as such, must be based on real events and facts. 
<br>If documentaries include made-up stories, then the film becomes another genre of fiction. 
<br>That is why I think being real is most important to a documentary. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>You are correct. Realism is a key aspect of the documentary genre. 
<br>I have been to many film festivals here and abroad, and have been analyzing their fairness. 
<br>Do you know the three largest film festivals in the world? 
<br>
<br>-VP of Fair Film Festival Committee
<br></div></div></div><div>Cannes, Venice, Berlin</div><div><div>Dear VP of Fair Film Festival Committee,
<br>
<br>It's the Cannes, Venice, and Berlin Film Festivals! I've seen ads for them on TV. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>I hope you get a chance to go to a film festival, particularly ours. 
<br>I can assure you we will be the most fair film festival you can think of. 
<br>I think we will be able to attend the RFA party once again. Thank you. 
<br>
<br>-VP of Fair Film Festival Committee
<br></div></div></div><div>Rome, London, and Tokyo</div><div><div>Dear VP of Fair Film Festival Committee,
<br>
<br>Uhm... I think it's the Rome, London, and Tokyo film festivals? Yes, I'm sure! I know they are all in major cities. Am I right? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>No, you only got the large city part right. I'd be more pleased if you take more interest in film festivals. 
<br>It takes a long time to select which films will be screened, so we will attend the party if we can adjust our schedules. 
<br>
<br>-VP of Fair Film Festival Committee
<br></div></div></div><div>Fiction</div><div><div>Dear VP of Fair Film Festival Committee,
<br>
<br>Documentaries are boring. They're not exciting at all... So I think fiction is the most important element!
<br>If you just add a little bit of fiction, the documentary can become really thrilling! 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>You must be ignorant of the documentary genre in its entirety. 
<br>I recommend you study before you embarrass yourself somewhere. 
<br>I'll go to the party if I can. 
<br>
<br>-VP of Fair Film Festival Committee
<br></div></div></div><div>Rated-R movies u///u</div><div><div>Dear VP of Fair Film Festival Committee,
<br>
<br>Hello! I'm {0}, RFA's party guest coordinator. 
<br>Oh my god. Boyhoodie... That's a rated-r movie...! You must be super fair to screen a film like that at the festival lolololololol
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>Wow, I never imagined someone would turn a heartfelt movie like Boyhoodie into a promiscuous film... 
<br>I have to attend a different film festival that day so I will have to miss the party. 
<br>Good luck.

Dear RFA Party Representative, 

Hello, I am the representative of the Assistant Human Rights Committee. 
All discussions concerning the party will go through me. Our organization investigates whether the rights of assistants are being secured. 
I was wondering what the situation is for assistants in RFA. What kind of a boss is Chief Assistant Kang's? 

Sincerely, Assistant Human Rights Committee Representative
</div><div>He is very practical.</div><div><div>Dear Assistant Human Rights Committee Representative, 
<br>
<br>Hello. I am {0}, the party guest coordinator.

<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Coordinator {0}, 
<br>
<br>There are good sides and bad sides to being practical. I'll make a note of it for now. 
<br>I still cannot discern whether her rights are being kept. How is her wage? Is she getting paid properly? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Assistant Human Rights Committee Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>More than enough.</div><div><div>
<br>Dear Assistant Human Rights Committee Representative, 
<br>
<br>I don't think anyone would say she gets paid enough or perhaps even worse.
<br>
<br>When she stays in the office after work hours, she seems to be getting paid for all the extra hours!
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0} 
<br></div><div> 
<br>Dear Coordinator {0}, 
<br>
<br>Hmm. More than enough wage... I made a note. 
<br>To be honest, many of our members attend party as assistants of the guests. We rarely attend events on our own as a group. 
<br>We always wear formal business suits, so I'm not sure what to wear. What clothes should I wear? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Assistant Human Rights Committee Representative
<br></div></div></div><div>Just your normal attire.</div><div><div>Dear Assistant Human Rights Committee Representative, 
<br>
<br>I think it will cost too much to purchase a new outfit just for this party.

<br>I think what you normally wear would be perfect!

Dear RFA Party Representative, 

Hello, I'm the manager of the Upcoming Writers group. 
They told me to act as the manager because I'm the youngest! Still getting to meet Zen was a special treat. 
We upcoming writers must advertise our books by ourselves. Will there be organizations or people to whom we can discuss our new works? 

Sincerely, Upcoming Writers Manager
</div><div>Art Organizations will be joining.</div><div><div>Dear Upcoming Writers Manager, 
<br>
<br>Hello, I am {0}, RFA's party guest coordinator. 
<br>We are planning to invite several art-related organizations to the party. 
<br>Novels, plays, films... Several representatives of different art fields will be attending, so it will be a good opportunity to advertise your works! 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>That sounds great! I should go over some of my previous works! It's a story about a girl who's a huge celebrity falling in love with the hottest guy in school! 
<br>Right, I need to give it a title. So I was thinking. How about "XOXOforeverurlovely#1star★" or "Stranger Kid"? Which one do you like?  
<br>I quite like both but people have such differing opinions! 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Upcoming Writers Manager
<br></div></div></div><div>XOXOforeverurlovely#1star★.</div><div><div>Dear Upcoming Writers Manager, 
<br>
<br>I feel like XOXOforeverurlovely#1star★ is a better title. 
<br>I think it will make many female readers nostalgic and feel the teenage love they once felt when they were young! 
<br>Make sure you put include classic lines like "Did it hurt when you fell from heaven?" or "I must be a snowflake, 'cause I've fallen for you!"
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Hello RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Oh, I really love the lines you gave me! Almost considered you a rival. But of course, even if that were the case, I'd be the winner!
<br>Now the title is set... and I just have to finish the ending...
<br>One is where the female lead flies off to space to become a true ★.
<br>And another is that the male lead's father turns out to be her mother's lost brother. 
<br>Which do you think is more original? 
<br>
<br>Best, Upcoming Writers Manager
<br></div></div></div><div>Flies off to space.</div><div><div>
<br>Dear Upcoming Writers Manager, 
<br>
<br>I think it's best if the female lead flies off to space! A tragedy leads her to becoming a star in the galaxy and she swears to always keep her lover in her heart... 
<br>At the end of the story, I'm thinking of writing "XOXO☆ForeverUrStar" so that it relates to the title perfectly! I think people are going to feel touched so much.
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Hello RFA Guest Coordinator,
<br>
<br>You even wrote my last sentence for me. I don't need that! ...is what I wish to say but I love it. 
<br>I can use it I assume? I can? Okay, thank you ^^
<br>I'll have to start rewriting right now if I want to take the manuscript to the party! Then see you there! 
<br>
<br>Best, Upcoming Writers Manager
<br></div></div></div><div>Male lead's father is her mother's lost brother.</div><div><div>Dear Upcoming Writers Manager, 
<br>
<br>If the male lead's father is her mother's lost brother...
<br>then I guess his father is her uncle and the male lead is her cousin? 
<br>Complicated family issues! I think this is quiet original, no? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Hello RFA Guest Coordinator,
<br>
<br>Oh, you are right. The female lead and male lead end up becoming cousins. 
<br>I think someone else already wrote about this idea... Hmm, I should search for a different one. 
<br>I'll go to the party if I finish the manuscript by then and won't if I don't. 
<br>If you want the party to succeed pray that I finish it by then! 
<br>
<br>Best, Upcoming Writers Manager
<br></div></div></div><div>Stranger Kid</div><div><div>Dear Upcoming Writers Manager, 
<br>
<br>I like Stranger Kid more! I... I don't know why but my guts tell me that this is the right title! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Hello RFA Guest Coordinator,
<br>
<br>Hmm... Come to think of it, I don't think that title fits the story I've written. It feels as if the title is sounds too pretentious for the story? 
<br>I should come up with another one! 
<br>If I finish rewriting before the party, I'll tell the members about it. If I remember it though. 
<br>
<br>Best, Upcoming Writers Manager
<br></div></div></div><div>More science related organizations than ones related to art...</div><div><div>Dear Upcoming Writers Manager, 
<br>
<br>Hello, I am {0}, the party guest coordinator. 
<br>There are almost no invited organizations that are in the art industry and most are in the science field. 
<br>So I think it will be great if you could come and provide some artistic insight ^^
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div> 
<br>Hello RFA Guest Coordinator,
<br>
<br>Then that means we won't get anything out of going. 
<br>I'm busy enough trying to write. You shouldn't have emailed me in the first place! I don't want to go to an event like that!

Dear RFA Representative, 

Hello, I am the representative of the group Men of Monogamy. 
The name says it all. We all desire to love one person and one person only for our whole lives...! I hope Yoosung, who told us about the party, seeks that kind of love as well! 
I heard that you are a woman. I would like to give my girlfriend a very, very special gift.. Could you recommend me what I should get? 

Sincerely, President of Men of Monogamy
</div><div>Personalized framed cross-stitch.</div><div><div>Dear President of Men of Monogamy, 
<br>
<br>Hello! I am {0}, the party coordinator. I'm sure all the women loved by those in your group are very happy. 
<br>I think a personalized framed cross-stitch piece would be good. It's so much effort to sew a whole painting for just one person in this world! I think she will be so happy to receive it. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>Cross-stitch...! That's a very good idea! A personalized piece that is completely unique...
<br>i guess then even if she loses it she won't be able to replace it so i'm sure she'll totally keep it safe and sound and just think of me and she'll feel how much i love her and continue loving me
<br>Oh, sorry. I got way too ahead of myself...^^ I just love my girlfriend so much... So I just want to be with her all the time... What should I do?  
<br>
<br>Best, President of Men of Monogamy 
<br></div></div></div><div>Buy her handcuffs.</div><div><div>Dear President of Men of Monogamy, 
<br>
<br>I... I was quite taken aback... but you indeed love her! If you want to be with your girlfriend, why don't you buy her handcuffs as a metaphor for your feelings?
<br>You can give her the handcuffs, and tell her something like "I'm your slave!" or "I want to be locked inside the prison that is your heart!", I'm sure your girlfriend would want to be with you too.  
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>Handcuffs...? What if i hurt her wrists then I'll feel so horrible but at least she won't be able to leave and she'll be mine...
<br>Oh I got lost in my own world again. I'm sorry. But you know... I can barely see her these days. I think she's cheating on me... I still love her so much. 
<br>What should I do? 
<br>
<br>Best, President of Men of Monogamy 
<br></div></div></div><div>Give her a bouquet of Jasmines.</div><div><div>Dear President of Men of Monogamy, 
<br>
<br>I'm not saying you should use the handcuffs. It's only a metaphor...! You're girlfriend will be surprised if you do that. Calm down. 
<br>Why don't you gift her a bouquet of Jasmine flowers? They say Jasmine represents eternal love. That will let her know how you feel. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>Jasmine...
<br>I should get a bouquet of 10,000 Jasmines and sneak into her room and secretly fill her room with flowers and then oh my god she will feel so happy and realize my feelings...
<br>I tend to get very extreme. It's a bad habit I try to fix... I should calm myself down and go see her. 
<br>Thanks to you, now I know how to express my feelings. Thank you. 
<br>I would like to see you and Yoosung and share a chat. I'll look forward to it. 
<br>
<br>Best, President of Men of Monogamy 
<br>P.S. Jasmines remind me of my favorite flowers Dandelion... It reminds me of some game I played... It was really fun... Hmm.
<br></div></div></div><div>Share an honest conversation.</div><div><div>Dear President of Men of Monogamy, 
<br>
<br>Don't think about using the handcuffs. I only meant that you should give her a metaphor for your feelings. If you really do that, you'll end up in jail
<br>If you think your girlfriend is cheating on you... why don't you talk to her about it? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>I've tried having conversations... She has to keep her eyes only on me, but she can't. I'm sure it's because of some other guy. 
<br>It's because of him that she can't keep her eyes on me and talking doesn't do anything and i have to find some other way... 
<br>If she's faithful to me again before the party, if my love works, then I will go to the party. Thank you. 
<br>
<br>Best, President of Men of Monogamy 
<br></div></div></div><div>Why don't you try focusing on something else?</div><div><div>Dear President of Men of Monogamy, 
<br>
<br>Your girlfriend will feel uncomfortable if all you think about is her. Why don't you spend time for yourself? 
<br>Maybe you can enjoy your hobby... or focus on studies... I think that will lead to a healthier relationship.
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>No i told you i want to spend the rest of my life with her.... i can't help myself so i have to talk to her right now. 
<br>I want to take her to the party... I'll go if I find a way to take her. If I do. 
<br>
<br>Best, President of Men of Monogamy 
<br></div></div></div><div>Car</div><div><div>Dear President of Men of Monogamy, 
<br>
<br>Hello! I'm {0}, the party guest coordinator. It's great to see men who are faithful! I admire that. 
<br>How about a car? It's how men show off their wealth these days, 
<br>and it will be easier to meet her with a car. I think she'll fall in love more! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>A car...? I'm broke... 
<br>But before that...
<br>What if i get her a car and she uses it to get far away from me? Or maybe she wants a car like you oh god i don't know...
<br>Uhm... Sorry. I should call her right now and ask. I think I will be very busy so I can't go to the party.

Dear RFA Representative, 

Hello! 707 told me to email you! He and I are both fervent lover of cats, so we always stay in touch! 
I know you must think our group weird. I just wanted to let cats taste really really good pancakes! 
We're creating a new recipe right now and we're wondering what to top it with T_T What do you think cats will like?

<br>
<br>Silvervine! They won't be able to eat it, but if we use the aroma, they'll love it! It's not addictive so it's safe!  
<br>Good. Now, we have to think of the sauce. Could you help us with that again?

<br>Warmest, President of Making Pancakes Cats Can Eat Committee 
<br></div></div></div><div>Salmon fish sauce.</div><div><div>Dear President of Making Pancakes Cats Can Eat Committee , 
<br>
<br>Since cats love salmon, if we make a sauce out of it to top the pancakes, they'll love it!

<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>What a good idea! Salmon is also very nutritious.
<br>With the combination of Silvervine and salmon, any cat will purr after the meal! Nice, {0}! 
<br>Oh, right. I have to order pancake tins. What shape would the cats be interested in? 
<br>
<br>Warmest, President of Making Pancakes Cats Can Eat Committee 
<br></div></div></div><div>Fish-shape.</div><div><div>Dear President of Making Pancakes Cats Can Eat Committee , 
<br>
<br>When you say cat, the first thing you think of is fish! And fish is supposed to contain a lot of the nutrients cats need! 
<br>I think it will be nice to have them fish-shaped so that people understand the pancakes are very nutritious. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div> 
<br>Dear {0},
<br>
<br>We've thought about many possible shapes, but as you suggested, fish-shape seems to be the best. 
<br>I never knew I'd find someone who loves cats as much as I and 707 do~ 
<br>I would love to talk to you in person at the party! See you there  ><!

<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>Hmm... Eating bones can be very dangerous to cats T_T

<br>Dear {0},
<br>
<br>What?;;; Vinegar is actually used to chase cats away;;

<br>
<br>Hello! I'm {0}, RFA's party coordinator. 
<br>How about squid? Since cats like fish, I think they'll like squid too! It will be good dried! 
<br>They can chew on it all they want. I think it's the best topping. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>Cats don't hate squid per se, but it's very salty and difficult to digest. It can potentially be dangerous;;
<br>We have to put more care into our new recipe, so we can't go to the party;;

Dear Charity Party Representative, 

Hello. I am from the Hands of Gold Bankers group and I will be in contact with you concerning the party. Mr. Han told us about the charity party. 
However, since our group consists of very powerful people, regardless of Mr. Han's recommendation, we must verify the event on our own. 
I would like to know more in detail about what kind of guests will be attending. So... shall we start talking? 
The easiest one first. Would you recommend me any package that would make a good investment these days? 

Sincerely, Hands of Gold Bankers Representative 
</div><div>100% Interest rate.</div><div><div>Dear Hands of Gold Bankers Representative,
<br>
<br>Hello. I am {0}, RFA's guest coordinator. I fully understand why you are cautious of attending the party. 
<br>I would like to recommend the 100% Interest rate package. I think it is the best for deposits. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div> 
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>100% Interest rate package. I've never heard about this before. I should invest in it. Of course! After I've done my own research and verified it. 
<br>Still, thank you. But these days, people say that banks have weak security. Where would you choose to deposit a hefty sum? What do you think is the safest bank? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Hands of Gold Bankers Representative 
<br></div></div></div><div>Swiss Bank</div><div><div>Dear Hands of Gold Bankers Representative, 
<br>
<br>I would deposit the sum at the Swiss Bank. If I deposit my money in a secret account there, no one but me and the bank will know it exists. That's how tight security is there.  
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Recently the whole secrecy aspect has been collapsing... but I admit it's a good idea considering you are not an expert. 
<br>I heard the party will be for charity, and it seems the hosts are greatly wealthy, including Mr. Han. 
<br>Are you wealthy as well? How much cash do you usually have in your wallet? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Hands of Gold Bankers Representative 
<br></div></div></div><div>$1.2million all in cash.</div><div><div>Dear Hands of Gold Bankers Representative,
<br>
<br>I don't have much in my wallet... just...
<br>
<br>$1.2million.
<br>
<br>All in cash. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>$1.2million...!! You must be a very fierce person to carry such wealth in your pockets! I haven't been this excited by anything in a while.
<br>After talking with a potential client, I mean, you, I can tell what kind of party it will be. 
<br>Since the coordinator is very reliable, I think the party will be safe as well. 
<br>If you have time, we should talk about your asset management plans in private. Then see you at the party. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Hands of Gold Bankers Representative 
<br></div></div></div><div>One card.</div><div><div>Dear Hands of Gold Bankers Representative, 
<br>
<br>To be honest, I don't have a lot of money so I only have one card in my wallet.
<br>The metro card...
<br>But unlike me, all the others hosts in the RFA are very well off!
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Hmm... There is the saying that opportunity makes the thief. 
<br>There is no guarantee that once you witness all those numbers being dropped at the party, you'll be possessed by greed. 
<br>I am quite nervous... I will have to think more carefully about attending the party. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Hands of Gold Bankers Representative 
<br></div></div></div><div>Bank of Neighborhood</div><div><div>Dear Hands of Gold Bankers Representative, 
<br>
<br>Hello! 
<br>If I had money to deposit, I'd just deposit it at the Bank of Neighborhood near my house. 
<br>Since I've been with them for a long time! Isn't trust the most important thing? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>How naive of you to think that you can trust a bank just because you've been with them for long. 
<br>You will get your back stabbed if you continue to believe so. I cannot believe a person like you was appointed to manage the guests...
<br>I'm worried there will be inappropriate people at the party. 
<br>We will have to have a long discussion about attending the party. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Hands of Gold Bankers Representative 
<br></div></div></div><div>Passed down for generations mortgage payment.</div><div><div>Dear Hands of Gold Bankers Representative, 
<br>
<br>Hello, I am the Guest Coordinator for RFA, {0}.
<br>Don't be so wary and please have faith in our party. 
<br>I heard of a packaged called Passed down for generations mortgage payment. How about it? 
<br>If I borrow money, the children of my children will have to pay off my depths, but I'll live such a comfortable and good life! That's so great! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Oh my god. Did you just say mortgage payments passed down for generations? 
<br>How could you even think to recommend such a ridiculous package... I can trust neither you nor the party. 
<br>We will not be attending.

My dear party coordinator, 

Hello~ I am the designer Angre Kim. 
My chiseled model Zen told me send you an email. 
I love parties, of course... especially if they have good champagne.. But we're currently determining the finale runway pose for our show. 
The decision has to be made in order to shine the party with my presence. 

~Angre Kim
</div><div>Hawk pose.</div><div><div>Hello, Designer Kim! 
<br>
<br>I am {0}, the party coordinator. Our party will be very elegant, and will perfectly match your aura and designs. 
<br>If I dare to make a suggestion concerning your currently problem, why don't the models pose like a hawk? 
<br>
<br>All the best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Hello {0},
<br>
<br>Why {0}, you have a beautiful name. 
<br>Hawk... That is very charming. I can picture it. Very beautiful. I am already inspired. 
<br>Hmm... But there are a couple more things to decide... I have to set the theme color for the next show... 
<br>Isn't there a color... that just oozes with purity and innocence...? 
<br>
<br>~Angre Kim
<br></div></div></div><div>Shiny White</div><div><div>Dear Designer Kim, 
<br>
<br>Hello! Thank you so much for complimenting my name. 
<br>If you are looking for purity, how about Shiny White? It is simple and elegant, and yet fancy and chic. I think the color will be perfect!  
<br>
<br>All the best, {0}
<br></div><div> 
<br>{0}, 
<br>
<br>Shiny White! Oh very nice. Very very nice. It is perfect for our brand... 
<br>Since the color is set... we have to decide the central piece for the show. 
<br>Between silk underwear with scarf and a classic coat... Which one do you think will be better? 
<br>I would like to hear your opinion~
<br>
<br>~Angre Kim
<br></div></div></div><div>Silk underwear with scarf</div><div><div>Dear Designer Kim, 
<br>
<br>It's good to hear back from you! Since your clothes have always inspired other people, 
<br>I think pairing silk underwear with a scarf will continue the brand's tradition. I very much look forward to the show. 
<br>
<br>All the best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>{0}, 
<br>
<br>You're a kind girl. Thanks to your good opinions, the next show will be great. 
<br>And I'll have time to go to the party. I'll give you an invitation to my next show when I see you there. 
<br>
<br>~Angre Kim
<br></div></div></div><div>Classic coat.</div><div><div>Dear Designer Kim, 
<br>
<br>I think a classic coat would be better. Isn't silk underwear with a scar a bit too much...? 
<br>
<br>All the best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>{0}, 
<br>
<br>A fashion designer must be bold and willing to create innovative pieces. 
<br>A designer cannot be afraid of going over the line... Your opinion was not helpful... 
<br>I will have to think and hear more opinions, so if all ends before the party, I'll go. 
<br>
<br>~Angre Kim
<br></div></div></div><div>Lovely pink.</div><div><div>Dear Designer Kim, 
<br>
<br>Pink, no doubt about it! Lovely pink is the best color. It's cute and adorable. Use something other than white!
<br>
<br>All the best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>{0},
<br>
<br>Hmm... I wanted to emphasize purity more than loveliness... 
<br>I think you have misunderstood me.. Color is very important so I'll have to think about it. 
<br>I'll think about going to the party if I can find time in my busy schedule. 
<br>
<br>~Angre Kim
<br></div></div></div><div>Create a heart shape with your arms over the head.</div><div><div>Dear Designer Angre Kim, 
<br>
<br>Hello. This is {0}, the party coordinator. 
<br>Why don't two models go to the front and draw a heart with their arms over their heads? 
<br>I think it'll be better if they shout "we love you~" to the audience. 
<br>
<br>All the best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>{0}, 
<br>
<br>I do not think you have a good understanding of fashion, fashion show, and the finale pose. 
<br>There are many more things I have to decide on so I will be too busy to attend the party. 
<br>Bye. 
<br>
<br>-Angre Kim

Dear Party Representative, 

Hello! This is Christmas Nolan. I'm a film direcot. 
The actor who stars in my friend's friend's colleague's best friend has told me to email you. 
I heard it's concerning some party... But if you are just interested in my name, I don't want to attend. 
So I have a couple questions for you, and I'll decided depending on your answer. 
Out of the two... tell me which movie I like. 

Best, Christmas Nolan
</div><div>Baleman</div><div><div>Dear Christmas Nolan, 
<br>
<br>Hello, Director Nolan. I am {0}, the party's guest coordinator. I am an admirer of your films. 
<br>Out of the two films, I think you'll like Baleman since you directed it yourself! And I also heard that you're not very fond of special effects ^^
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Oh, so you already know that I don't like special effects. You're right. I like Baleman better. 
<br>If you know about me already, I'm sure the next question is easy. Please tell me the title of the space film that I directed. 
<br>
<br>Best, Christmas Nolan
<br></div></div></div><div>Onthestellar</div><div><div>Dear Christmas Nolan, 
<br>
<br>How can I get this wrong? haha. It's Onthestellar. 
<br>It was an amazing experience watching the film and I was very inspired. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>{0}, so you really have seen all my films. Okay then. I have another question for you. 
<br>This isn't a question about me, so it might be difficult. If you answer correctly the name of my male lead for Outception, I will attend the party. 
<br>
<br>Best, Christmas Nolan
<br></div></div></div><div>Leonardo Dicappucino</div><div><div>Dear Christmas Nolan, 
<br>
<br>Leonardo Dicappucino! I knew the answer as soon as I saw your question. He was very good in that ingenious film of yours. 
<br>I almost cried watching his acting. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>{0}, 
<br>
<br>Wow. You are indeed my fan. I apologize for being somewhat hostile in my first email.
<br>Since you've answered all three of my questions correctly, I'll attend the party. Please email me the details later. 
<br>Then see you then. 
<br>
<br>Best, Christmas Nolan
<br></div></div></div><div>Audrey Heartburn</div><div><div>Dear Christmas Nolan, 
<br>
<br>The male lead for Outception is... uhm... well... the one with black hair... looks really good with short hair...  Audrey Heartburn? 
<br>Doesn't he pretend to have his arm cut off in the middle? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Party Coordinator, 
<br>Wrong. You are incorrect. Audrey Heartburn is a woman and she has never starred in my movie. And the film I was talking about does not contain any such scenes. 
<br>Still, since you answered two questions correctly... I'll think about the party. 
<br>
<br>Best, Christmas Nolan
<br></div></div></div><div>Wonder Kittie</div><div><div>Dear Christmas Nolan, 
<br>
<br>I know that film very well! It's the movie set in 2025! 2025 Wonder Kittie!
<br>I thoroughly enjoyed the part with the spaceship and the alien prince. I used to sing that song all the time. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Wrong. You must have been lucky to get the first question correct. 
<br>I recommend you take another look at my filmography. 
<br>I'll think about going to the party if I have nothing to do. If I really have nothing to do. 
<br>
<br>Best, Christmas Nolan
<br></div></div></div><div>Avatardy 3D</div><div><div>Dear Christmas Nolan, 
<br>
<br>Hello. I am {0}, the party's guest coordinator. Hmm... I think you'll like Avatardy 3D! 
<br>It's a film that a billion people have seen all over the world, and the special effects are very beautiful. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>I do not like special effects. 
<br>I said I don't like people inviting me just because of my fame, and I see that you know nothing about me. 
<br>I will not attend the party.

Dear RFA Party Coordinator, 

Hello. I am the host of the LOLOL World Championship Tournament, Cream Roll. I am Soft Roll. 
Thank you for inviting us to the charity party... but we are currently busy preparing for the tournament. We might be able to speed up if you give us some of your opinions. 
It's a tournament that people from all over the world will be attending, so we'd like to invite a famous singer to perform. Would you know any? 

Best, Soft Roll
</div><div>The rock band Imagine Mythical Creatures.</div><div><div>Dear Soft Roll, 
<br>
<br>Hello. I am {0}. We would really love to have you at the party.  
<br>I hope I can give some help to the tournament. I would invite the famous rock band Imagine Mythical Creatures. 
<br>It's a hot band these days, and the songs fit with the game well, so it will excite everyone at the tournament. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0},
<br>
<br>Oh, you listen to Imagine Mythical Creatures? I didn't think you would. 
<br>.
<br>.
<br>That's a good choice. Of course we still have a lot of issues to solve, so don't assume I can go yet. 
<br>We're thinking of giving out limited edition merch goods to people who come to the tournament. If you suggest a good one again, I might just make it!
<br>
<br>Best, Soft Roll
<br></div></div></div><div>Limited edition title change ticket.</div><div><div>Dear Soft Roll, 
<br>
<br>Hmm. I think merch goods will be hard to satisfy everyone. Some might not use it at all. 
<br>So I'd give out a ticket that lets users change their titles to "The One Who Viewed Cream Roll" within the game. 
<br>They can just put it inside their pockets during the tournament, and show it off within the game. 
<br>I think that will make others want to go next year. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>Hmm. I see many more people will get to know about it if it's applied in the game. 
<br>I'll have to discuss it with my team. You're better than I thought you'd be haha. 
<br>Now, what should we give the winner? This will pretty much solve all the major issues. 
<br>
<br>Best, Soft Roll
<br></div></div></div><div>Create a banner of the winner.</div><div><div>Dear Soft Roll, 
<br>
<br>How about creating a banner with the winner as the model? You can accentuate some unique feature about him or her. 
<br>I think it will be nice to sell it to people. That way they'll never forget who won the tournament that year. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>That's perfect. I didn't really expect much from you. But thank you!
<br>I'll go to the party. Since I'm taking time out of my busy schedule to go, make sure it's fun! haha
<br>
<br>Best, Soft Roll
<br></div></div></div><div>99 tickets for weapon strengthening.</div><div><div>Dear Soft Roll,
<br>
<br>How about 99 tickets for weapon strengthening? It is a free item, but won't 99 tickets be good enough? 
<br>It won't cost anything so that will be good for you. The item already exists anyways. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0},
<br>
<br>A free item for the top prize? That won't motivate anyone. 
<br>Besides, if they are good enough to compete and win the tournament, their weapons will be strengthened to the max. 
<br>I would have said I'd be going for sure if you came up with a better idea... 
<br>But I'll have to see. 
<br>
<br>Best, Soft Roll
<br></div></div></div><div>110cm tall doll.</div><div><div>Dear Soft Roll,
<br>
<br>How about a huge doll? You can create a 110cm tall doll to hand out to the people who come! 
<br>It will be hilarious watching all those people carrying that huge as doll while going home! lolololol
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>I think they'll have a hard time finding a place for the doll while viewing the tournament. 
<br>It'll just take space. A small figurine would be better perhaps. 
<br>Well... I didn't look forward to your answer in the first place. I'll be too busy to go to the party. 
<br>
<br>Best, Soft Roll
<br></div></div></div><div>A quiet, melodic song.</div><div><div>Dear Soft Roll, 
<br>
<br>Hello! I'm {0}. I hope I can be of help so that you can come to the party. 
<br>How about having an orchestra play a quiet and melodic song to calm down all the players and viewers? 
<br>Everyone will be so relaxed before watching the game!
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0},
<br>
<br>Hahahahaha. Your idea is more boring than I expected. 
<br>Well, I didn't even think you'd come up with a good idea. I have to go to a meeting now. 
<br>Good bye.

Dear RFA Representative, 

Come to Cherry Farm for the freshest cherries on earth! 
Hello, I'm the owner of Cherry Farm. 
I haven't grown cherries for long, but I can assure you they are as sweet and tasty, if not more, as other farms. 
You can determine how fresh they are by the color of the stem. Do you know which color means they are fresh? 

Best, Cherry Farm Owner
</div><div>Green.</div><div><div>Dear Cherry Farm Owner, 
<br>
<br>Hello. I am {0}, RFA's party guest coordinator! 
<br>I really love cherries! I'm so excited to talk to someone who actually grows them :) 
<br>Aren't cherries fresh the more green their stems are? I always make sure to look at the stems before buying! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>If I go to the party, you'll be able to taste our cherries there. 
<br>If you want some right now, call our farm asap... Ahem, I mean, never mind. 
<br>There's one inconvenient aspect about eating cherries, which is the seed. 
<br>You have to spit it out every time you eat, so it's much more convenient if you get rid of it first. 
<br>What method do you use to get rid of the seed? 
<br>
<br>Best, Cherry Farm Owner
<br></div></div></div><div>Poke it out a straw!</div><div><div>Dear Cherry Farm Owner, 
<br>
<br>I take out the stem, and use a straw to push out the seed! I always have a straw in hand when I eat cherries. 
<br>I'm really a huge fan ><! I really want some right now~
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0},
<br>
<br>If you really want cherries, just call XXX-XXXX-XXXX and... Ahem, I mean, never mind. 
<br>Do you know what cherries are called? 
<br>People compare it to a jewel. Do you know what? 
<br>
<br>Best, Cherry Farm Owner
<br></div></div></div><div>Diamond</div><div><div>Dear Cherry Farm Owner, 
<br>
<br>Diamond! I thought it'd be ruby since they are red, but it's diamond! 
<br>They smell and taste good, and are even good for your health! 
<br>I'd feel so rich if I have a basket full of cherries~
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear future client {0}, 
<br>I would love to tell you how good our cherries are. 
<br>We can provide free cherries at the party. If you really love our cherries, please call.... 
<br>Hahaha. I'm only joking.... or am I? Anyways, see you at the party, future client of ours ^^
<br>
<br>Best, Cherry Farm Owner
<br></div></div></div><div>Ruby</div><div><div>Dear Cherry Farm Owner, 
<br>
<br>Since cherries are bright red, they call it rubies! I'm sure if I put a cherry through a silver chain, people will think I'm wearing a ruby necklace! 
<br>I'll seem royal from afar! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>I see that you like cherries, but I guess you don't know their nickname. 
<br>A lot of people say that because cherries are red. 
<br>I can't tell you I'll be at the party for sure, but I'll try adjusting my schedule. 
<br>Call me anytime you want cherries ^^ 
<br>
<br>Best, Cherry Farm Owner
<br></div></div></div><div>Crush it with a spoon!</div><div><div>Dear Cherry Farmer, 
<br>
<br>Of course I know~ You dig out the seed with a spoon. 
<br>If it doesn't work very well, you just crush it with all your might! 
<br>I know how to eat my cherries. Right? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>Then the fruit will get severely damaged. 
<br>I recommend you use another tool. 
<br>I'd feel sad if some treats my cherries that well...
<br>I'll think about going to the party if I finish my work at the farm that day. 
<br>
<br>Best, Cherry Farm Owner
<br></div></div></div><div>Brown</div><div><div>Dear Cherry Farm Owner, 
<br>
<br>Hello. I'm {0}, RFA's representative. 
<br>I don't know much about cherries... Maybe brown? And green means they are unripe? 
<br>I thought cherries with green stems have a bunch of preservatives on them. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>The greener the stems are, the more fresh the fruit is. 
<br>Did you think that way all this time? 
<br>We always try to serve cherries at their best, and comments like that are so discouraging. 
<br>
<br>Best, Cherry Farm Owner

Dear RFA's party representative, 

Hello! 
We are a group that aims to freeze the tuition of all universities across the nation. 
We even shaved our heads to show how committed we are to the cause! 
It's not because I'm already bald...! Nope, never! That is never the case!!
I think many people will know about our cause through the party. 
We'd like to go out onto the streets beforehand and tell people of our cause. When do you think is the best time? 

Sincerely, President of National Freeze University Tuition Committee
</div><div>Noon.</div><div><div>Dear President of National Freeze University Tuition Committee,
<br>
<br>Hello! I'm {0}, RFA's party guest coordinator. 
<br>Many students will be lessened of their burden if tuitions are frozen, so I think it's a good cause. 
<br>I think noon is a good time since people will be out and about for lunch!
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Thank you! We should also go out in the evening when people are going home from work! 
<br>We don't want to make a racket, so we're planning of holding pickets! 
<br>But I have zero sense in colors. 
<br>I'd really appreciate it if you could recommend a color combination that pops out! 
<br>
<br>Best, President of National Freeze University Tuition Committee
<br></div></div></div><div>Yellow and black.</div><div><div>Dear President of National Freeze University Tuition Committee, 
<br>
<br>How about black and yellow? Even when we study, we highlight black text with yello.  
<br>Like that, you could write in yellow on a black background or vice versa. 
<br>I think those two colors really pop out. Why don't you try it? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Thank you! I first thought of red and orange, but my teammates would have killed me if I said that! haha
<br>All the members love your recommendation. 
<br>As I said, we want to go out during the evening as well. Do you know anything else we can bring to the protest? 
<br>
<br>Best, President of National Freeze University Tuition Committee
<br></div></div></div><div>Candlelight</div><div><div>Dear President of National Freeze University Tuition Committee, 
<br>
<br>Why don't you guys stand in line and hold candlelights? 
<br>I think it will be a good metaphor for the cause. 
<br>I'll support the movement! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Thank you! We will do our best for the students!
<br>Thank you so much for inviting our committee to the party! 
<br>See you there! 
<br>
<br>Best, President of National Freeze University Tuition Committee
<br></div></div></div><div>Octopus costume.</div><div><div>Dear President of National Freeze University Tuition Committee, 
<br>
<br>I highly recommend an octopus costume!!
<br>I feel like... the round head will just gather everyone's hearts together. 
<br>And the shiny head... represents everyone's eyes. The octopus legs also represent how the movements aims to touch upon everyone around the nation. 
<br>Isn't that nice? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>I... I think the octopus costume will remind people of something else... Like, like my head... I mean, never mind. 
<br>We'll have to discuss more about what to take. 
<br>We'll go to the party if we don't have a meeting scheduled then! 
<br>
<br>Best, President of National Freeze University Tuition Committee
<br></div></div></div><div>Peach and black.</div><div><div>Dear President of National Freeze University Tuition Committee, 
<br>
<br>How about peach and black? 
<br>I think it will remind people of you. 
<br>Going bald! lololol I mean, you said you shaved it on purpose, right? lololol
<br>Anyways, I doubt people will forget you holding up a picket any time soon. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Please be serious! The academic career of many students is on the line! 
<br>I am quite offended. -_- If I feel better, I will go, if not, you will not see me there. 
<br>
<br>Best, President of National Freeze University Tuition Committee
<br></div></div></div><div>When it's bright (just like your head)</div><div><div>Dear President of National Freeze University Tuition Committee, 
<br>
<br>Hello. It's {0}. 
<br>Hmm, how about when it's bright and shiny just like your head? lolololol 
<br>Honestly, if your bald you'll be noticed any time lolololol Ahem, I recommend when it's bright and shiny, just like... lolololololol
<br>I'll support your cause! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>You ignore our cause and just laugh at my looks. 
<br>Ignoring me is just like ignoring the committee!
<br>You'll turn bald one day too!

Dear RFA Representative, 

Hello! I'm the manager of the Coffee Roastery Association where we roast coffee beans ourselves. 
I'm honored to be invited to the party. The one who told us about it must really like coffee, her eyes were very bright. 
So we'd like to roast some beans for the party. Which kind do you think will be best? 

Best, Manager of Coffee Roastery Association
</div><div>Antigua.</div><div><div>Dear Manager of Coffee Roastery Association, 
<br>
<br>Hello! I'm {0}. It's amazing that you roast the beans yourself! 
<br>Why don't you try a more unique kind? Like Antigua! 
<br>I've only heard about it so I'm eager to find out what that smoky aroma really feels like! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>Antigua is very good. I'll roast high quality beans to take to the party. 
<br>Is there a grinder there? If there is, we'll take the beans. That way, the coffee will be more aromatic. 
<br>Do you know what people call coffee beans that are not ground? 
<br>
<br>Best, Manager of Coffee Roastery Association
<br></div></div></div><div>Whole beans.</div><div><div>Dear Manager of Coffee Roastery Association, 
<br>
<br>Of course! It's whole beans~ A friend told me it's beter to by whole beans rather than ground ones. 
<br>I don't have a grinder, so I haven't bought them yet... We can provide a grinder if needed. Don't worry! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>Thank you! I'll put a lot of care into roasting the beans. You seem interested in coffee. I'd like to tell you more. 
<br>Did your friend tell you how many days roasted beans last? 
<br>
<br>Best, Manager of Coffee Roastery Association, 
<br></div></div></div><div>15 days.</div><div><div>Dear Manager of Coffee Roastery Association, 
<br>
<br>15 days! I heard that coffee beans are pretty sensitive to their environment. Afterwards, the flavor and aroma will fade. 
<br>I'm realizing more and more how rich the world of coffee is! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>You're right. The taste changes after 15 days from roasting the beans, so it's nice to brew it before then. 
<br>This is why it's better to buy whole beans. Ground ones last shorter. 
<br>We will make sure to bring beans that are less than 15 days old, so that people can taste it right away. 
<br>I look forward to your thoughts on the coffee. See you then. 
<br>
<br>Best, Manager of Coffee Roastery Association, 
<br></div></div></div><div>About 60 days.</div><div><div>Dear Manager of Coffee Roastery Association, 
<br>
<br>Hmm, I didn't hear about that. Maybe 30 days? Isn't it better the older they are? 
<br>I know that the beans turn black once they are roasted. Aren't they not perishable? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>After you roast the coffee beans, the flavor starts to change. It will be completely different in 60 days. 
<br>I'll tell you at the party when you should brew it. But we're planning to receive raw beans that day, so I'm not completely sure. 
<br>
<br>Best, Manager of Coffee Roastery Association, 
<br></div></div></div><div>Sean Bean.</div><div><div>Dear Manager of Coffee Roastery Association, 
<br>
<br>Sean Bean!! ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY SELECT ANY BEANS! But what if the beans die after their first roast? lolololol
<br>Please brew my coffee with Sean Bean~ Please~~~
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>Hmm. Haha, nice joke. I was sad when Ned Stump died.... 
<br>But what do we do? We're almost out of Antigua beans, so we have to put an order. 
<br>I'll go to the party if I can find them before then. 
<br>
<br>Best, Manager of Coffee Roastery Association
<br></div></div></div><div>Iguana.</div><div><div>Dear Manager of Coffee Roastery Association
<br>
<br>Hello! I'm {0}, RFA's party guest coordinator, 
<br>Iguana coffee! My friend said that it's really good. 
<br>But do you think these beans come from Iguana excrement, like those from cat litter? Ewww!
<br>Still! I'd like to taste Iguana coffee!!
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0},
<br>
<br>I think you mean Iguacu coffee... And that's instant coffee. 
<br>We have no reason to go to the party if you wish to drink instant coffee. 
<br>I hope you enjoy that pathetic taste.

You don't need to tell us who you are. We already know your name. {0}. Although that jerk 707 made sure we don't find out anything else. 
Still, 707 invited us himself, and we've been chasing him all this time. A prey walks into a tiger's den.

<br>Isn't that really cool? Be polite though, he's an elder.

<br></div><div>
<br>Hey {0},

<br>707 is 80 years old...??? This is shocking... So I guess his skills come from experience.

Dear Seven's friend, 

Hi, I'm Seven's friend Tom. He suddenly told me they were holding some party and that I should reach you. 
I'm just a really normal person so I don't know if I'll fit in... My uncle might though. He always has dreams that predict what will happen in the next few days. 
Yesterday I heard he had a dream about a wolf running loose in a zoo....

Best, Tom. 
</div><div>Call the zoo!</div><div><div>Dear Tom, 
<br>
<br>Hello! I'm {0}, and I'm preparing the upcoming party with Seven. 
<br>Maybe he's having fortune telling dreams? Then please call the zoo to make sure they have the wolf safely caged! 
<br>Something dangerous might happen!
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>I called right after I received your email and apparently, the lock was broken! OMG my uncle was right! 
<br>Still, you believed my uncle! A lot of people just tell me it's a coincidence. Do you want to hear another dream? 
<br>The dream's couple days old, but he dreamt that a peach rose high up to the sky and flew away. What does that mean? 
<br>
<br>Best, Tom
<br></div></div></div><div>Stock prices of peach drinks going up. </div><div><div>Dear Tom, 
<br>
<br>Hmm. Doesn't that mean that the stock price of peach drinks will go up? 
<br>I heard that the company's stock was hitting rock bottom. Maybe it's going to rise back up! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div> 
<br>Hi {0}, 
<br>
<br>Wow you were right! Apparently, a singer said that's the only thing she drinks and advertised it. So their shares are on the rise all of a sudden. 
<br>I should have bought some shares too. So my uncle can help me this way... Wow... New discovery! 
<br>But you know... he just had a nap but apparently in his dreams, someone was holding two guns to my face. What should I do...? 
<br>
<br>Tom
<br></div></div></div><div>It means your grades! Two Fs!!</div><div><div>Dear Tom, 
<br>
<br>That... That must mean that you're getting two Fs!! Your GPA is going to get shot and die!

<br>Hi {0}, 
<br>
<br>I hired a body guard as soon as I got your email but nothing happened...

<br>I'll go to the party depending on whether I can work!

Our hotel already has top quality facilities... but what should we add for our new hotels? 

-Owner of Meowtel 
</div><div>Cat buffet. </div><div><div>Dear Owner of Meowtel 
<br>
<br>Hello, I am {0}. 
<br>I would prepare a cat buffet so that cats can choose whatever they want to eat! 
<br>Dry food and wet food prepared by world famous chefs in all kind of flavors such as tuna, salmon, chicken, beef, and etc.!! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Now that would draw in even the pickiest of our dear cats. 
<br>Then we would also need to offer something their eyes can enjoy. Any ideas?
<br>
<br>-Owner of Meowtel
<br></div></div></div><div>How about people putting on a show?</div><div><div>Dear Owner of Meowtel, 
<br>
<br>Hmm... Since cats have to rest comfortably at the Meowtel...
<br>Why don't people come out with toys that cat like and put on some sort of show?
<br>People call cats the owners and the people their butlers anyways. The perfect show for the cats! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>That's a fun idea!
<br>I was just thinking of showing them animation movies of mice running around. 
<br>I should hire a director to create the show and actors to star in it. Now, we only have one more issue to solve. 
<br>I'm planning to create several buildings for the new hotel. What transportation should I use for the cats to get around from building to building? 
<br>
<br>-Owner of Meowtel 
<br></div></div></div><div>Cat limousine!</div><div><div>Dear Owner of Meowtel, 
<br>
<br>A fancy hotel must have a limousine! You can take the cats on a ride in long limousines. 
<br>You can also offer services of going to the owner's houses to pick up the cats or taking them somewhere else, and such. 
<br>A service only possible at Meowtel! How about it? 
<br>
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>It will be costly, but that is nothing if we can provide high quality service to our cats...
<br>I have much less work now thanks to you. It's now my chance to get some rest. 
<br>I will spend one of my days off at your party. I will look forward to it. 
<br>
<br>-Owner of Meowtel
<br></div></div></div><div>Cat Stroller! </div><div><div>Dear Owner of Meowtel, 
<br>
<br>Cats hate cars and they'll get stressed out if you force them onto one... 
<br>So I would rather put them on a stroller and almost make them feel as if they're out for a walk! 
<br>They can look at the view and they won't get carsick or anything like that. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>They I'll have to hire more workers to push the strollers. It sounds like an unnecessary cost... 
<br>And the strollers will be very shaky... I'll have to come up with a more comfortable way for the cats. 
<br>Still, I got a considerable amount done. I will consider the party and hope to be there. 
<br>
<br>-Owner of Meowtel
<br></div></div></div><div>Cat Moulin Rouge! </div><div><div>Dear Meowtel Owner, 
<br>
<br>How about you dress the cats in pretty costumes and make them dance!
<br>A cat version of Moulin Rouge! The cats on stage might have a hard time but whatever. 
<br>I think the viewers will love it though. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>We provide a space for rest to all cats. ALL cats. 
<br>I don't want to make cats do work. As I expected, I'll have to talk to an expert. 
<br>I'll schedule a meeting with a show expert first and then see about the party. 
<br>
<br>-Owner of Meowtel
<br></div></div></div><div>Cat wine bar. </div><div><div>Dear Owner of Meowtel, 
<br>
<br>Hello, I'm {0}, RFA's guest coordinator! 
<br>I would create a wine bar for cats. They can sit on the bar and lick wine! It will make an amazing sight, won't it? 
<br>Such a cool atmosphere! They can get all tipsy and fall asleep easily. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>Are you saying we should get cats drunk? Don't you know that alcohol is forbidden to cats? 
<br>Regardless of the atmosphere, you should have thought about what makes cats comfortable first. 
<br>I will not go to the party. 
<br>
<br>-Owner of Meowtel

Dear RFA's Guest Coordinator, 

Hello. 
I am Driver Kim. Zen told me that this will be a fun party. 
But my son's been causing trouble these days so I'm not sure if I can go.. 
He said that he wants to quit school and start racing since everyone in the family has been drivers. 
He has already spent a lot of money to do the sport. What can I do to get him back on the right track? 

Forever young in heart, Driver Kim
</div><div>Compete with your son. </div><div><div>Dear Driver Kim, 
<br>
<br>Hello! I'm {0}. 
<br>I'm so glad to invite someone who has amazing driving skills. I would love to ride a car that you drive. 
<br>So you're having trouble with your son. Why don't you try making a deal with him? 
<br>You two can race, and if he wins you'll support his goal and if he loses, he'll follow what you say. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>I think that is a very good idea. 
<br>It's been long since I've been behind the wheel, so if he wins over me, he must be really talented. 
<br>But I will not go easy on him. My special move is turning a corner by letting the back wheels slip.
<br>
<br>Magician of turning corners, Driver Kim
<br></div></div></div><div>Drifting! </div><div><div>Dear Driver Kim,
<br>
<br>I know what that is! Drifting! I heard that's really hard. Wow. 
<br>I'm sure your son will be speechless once he sees your special move!
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>I thought you wouldn't know what drifting is, but you knew ^^
<br>I have no intention to lose, so I'll have to pick out a good car. Should I take the car I had since when I was young Pong or the new model from Berrari? 
<br>
<br>Passionate as always, Driver Kim 
<br></div></div></div><div>Car from when you were young Pong!</div><div><div>Dear Driver Kim,
<br>
<br>You have to take the car you drove when you were young! 
<br>Nothing like traces from your youth to spark your passion again! 
<br>I'm sure you'll definitely win. I'll hope for the best! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Thank you for your support. I will put on a good race with my old friend, Pong. 
<br>I feel bad for my son... buy competition is fair. I will make sure to win and attend the party. 
<br>
<br>Miracle Racer, Driver Kim 
<br></div></div></div><div>The new model from Berrari. </div><div><div>Dear Driver Kim, 
<br>
<br>It's important to have the best tank for a race! I think you should take the new Berrari for sure. 
<br>How good can an old car be? I'm sure the new car is way~~ better!!
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>The Berrari is definitely a good car. But I think it will take time to get it ready...
<br>I don't know if I'll be able to race before the party... I'll adjust my schedule the best I can and go. 
<br>Hope you have a good day. 
<br>
<br>Forever a wanderlust, Driver Kim 
<br></div></div></div><div>Drafting! </div><div><div>Dear Driver Kim, 
<br>
<br>Wow! Drafting is your special move? Omg! That shrieking sound and those tire marks!
<br>I only saw it on TV and movies! I'd love to go see it! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>I think draft means selecting players for sports teams ^^ Anyone can make mistakes of course. 
<br>But I cannot afford to make a mistake on this race with my son. I will attend the party if I have time in between practices. 
<br>Have a good day. 
<br>
<br>Magician of turning corners, Driver Kim 
<br></div></div></div><div>Trust me with guts!</div><div><div>Dear Driver Kim, 
<br>
<br>Hello! I'm {0}, RFA's guest coordinator. 
<br>Can't you just trust your son and support him? Adults always try to stop us. So uptight! 
<br>Stop doubting your son and trust him!
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>It was not polite for you to call me uptight without knowing the whole story. 
<br>I don't think I can go to the party feeling like this. 
<br>Good luck. 
<br>
<br>-Driver Kim

Dear Charity Party Representative, 

Hello, I'm the representative for a group of students who live on our own. 
I can finally get a proper meal at the party... Ahem, I mean I think the party has a good cause. A good cause for our stomachs... haha 
I think taking care of our meals is the most difficult. You have to cook, store, wash the dishes, etc... 
It's difficult to cook small portions, and it's hard to make sure they keep T_T
Please help us~!

Best, Representative of Students Living Alone 
</div><div>To the freezer! </div><div><div>Hi Representative of Students Living Alone, 
<br>
<br>Hello! I'm {0}. 
<br>I'm sure it must be hard to live on your own. You won't have to worry about meals if you lived in a dorm. 
<br>To give you a tip, after you cook rice, divide it into one portion sizes and freeze them! 
<br>You can heat one up when you need and it's basically like instant rice! Never skip meals! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Party Representative, 
<br>
<br>I put rice in my rice cooker as soon as I read your email. 
<br>Even if I don't put it in the freezer in the winter I can just put it out the window... I mean, just inside my room and it will freeze. 
<br>Where I live is a bit... no, really cold. I feel like I'm living at the north pole...
<br>Gas bills are expensive.. Save me T_T!! 
<br>
<br>Best, Representative of Students Living Alone 
<br></div></div></div><div>Bubblewrap on the window. </div><div><div>Dear Representative of Students Living Alone, 
<br>
<br>You're place is that chilly? Then put bubblewrap on the window! 
<br>I heard that the room temperature goes up if you do that. They say it's almost like wearing another layer. 
<br>Please make sure you're warm during the winter! 
<br>
<br>Best. {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Representative of Students Living Alone, 
<br>
<br>I should ge somet bybblerwrap right now! 
<br>I'm eaiting right now, so plz excuse my ytypos. I'm forcing down all of my leftovers... 
<br>You always get so many ingredients left over when you cook... 
<br>Help me again please~~!
<br>
<br>Best, Representative of Students Living Alone 
<br></div></div></div><div>Fried rice. </div><div><div>Dear Representative of Students Living Alone, 
<br>
<br>When you have a lot of ingredients left over, just make fried rice! 
<br>You can pretty much put anything and make it taste delicious! 
<br>You can take care of multiple ingredients at once, so that's good! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Party Representative, 
<br>
<br>I never thought of that! Next time I have some left, I'll thaw the rice and just mix them together. 
<br>I should tell people in my group this... Thank you so much! Another meal taken care of! 
<br>I'll be able to take care of another meal if I go to the party I guess! Yay! I should bring some back.. Ahem. Anyways, 
<br>See you at the party!! 
<br>
<br>Best, Representative of Students Living Alone 
<br></div></div></div><div>To the freezer! </div><div><div>Dear Representative of Students Living Alone, 
<br>
<br>You put the rice in the freezer so just put them in there too! 
<br>It won't go bad so if you think they might go bad anytime soon just put freeze them!
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Representative of Students Living Alone, 
<br>
<br>But if I put them in the freezer I rarely take it out again... The freezer is like a frightening dark cave! 
<br>Last time I found something I put in about a year ago... I kind of want to take care of them right away. 
<br>I should just invite my friends for now and have them eat the leftovers. 
<br>I'm really looking forward to the food at the party but I think it's my friend's grandmother's cousin's husband's birthday... I'll go wherever the food looks better! 
<br>
<br>Best, Representative of Students Living Alone 
<br></div></div></div><div>Put newspaper on the windows! </div><div><div>Dear Representative of Students Living Alone, 
<br>
<br>I see homeless people sleeping with newspaper on, so it must mean they keep you warm. Try putting that on the windows! 
<br>You can use water to slap them on. I think your room will feel like a warm cave if you do that. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Representative of Students Living Alone, 
<br>
<br>Hmm. Don't you do that when there's a storm outside? That's what I did last year. 
<br>I think it's better to stick some newspaper under the window sill. 
<br>Party 
<br>
<br>Best, Representative of Students Living Alone 
<br></div></div></div><div>Keep them inside the rice cooker. </div><div><div>Dear Representative of Students Living Alone, 
<br>
<br>Hello! I'm {0}. 
<br>I guess you'll have a lot to take care of living by yourself T_T But you know, you can just keep the rice inside the rice cooker! 
<br>Can't you keep it in there for however long you want? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Representative of Students Living Alone, 
<br>
<br>Uhm;;; I just kept the rice in there after reading your email but now it's turning hard...
<br>I think I have to throw it away -_- It was a waste of money... damn...
<br>I can't afford to go to a charity party. Then good bye.

Dear Madam offering us the invitation, 

How do you do? I am John Doe, a humble member of the Pious Son Committee. 
I am still far from being a pious son, but 
we have gathered to encourage each other in the cause and continue on. 

But I have to ask you something... I just forgot... It's very frustrating... Could you tell me the answer to this?  
What is the root of all virtues? 
Does the Madam happen to know the answer? 

Sincerely yours, John Doe, Member of the Pious Son Committee
</div><div>Filial Piety</div><div><div>Dear Mr. John Doe, 
<br>
<br>Hello Mr. Doe :) My name is {0}, RFA's party guest coordinator. 
<br>Your name reminds me of those who get lost in the world, never to be identified and returned to their parents...
<br>The answer to your question is 'filial piety' :) That is the root of all virtues. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0} 
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Madam, 
<br>
<br>Oh! Yes! Stupid me had forgotten. Sometimes, I forget the most important things! 
<br>Very rarely however, I must add... 
<br>You know, I saw a crow flying in the sky today. And the way it kept flying on and on reminded me of this saying. 
<br>"While your parents are alive, do not travel afar. If you have to travel, you must leave an address." 
<br>I can't remember who said that this time... Could Madam please help me again? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely yours, John Doe, Member of the Pious Son Committee
<br></div></div></div><div>Confucious</div><div><div>Dear Mr. John Doe, 
<br>
<br>It's Confucius! I am sure you were thinking of him. :) 
<br>I can help you anytime when it concerns the way of filial piety. 
<br>You must be such a good son to your parents. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0} 
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Madam, 
<br>
<br>I still have a very long way to go to repay my parents for all they have done... 
<br>Lastly, I have to ask you this.... 
<br>To be the best son to parents... would it be better to be rich or be healthy...? 
<br>I think I know the answer, but I keep going back and forth between the two.... I'm ashamed that I do not know the answer...
<br>
<br>Sincerely yours, John Doe, Member of the Pious Son Committee
<br></div></div></div><div>Be healthy</div><div><div>Dear Mr. Doe, 
<br>
<br>Be heathy! I'm sure that your parents want nothing more from you than you being healthy. 
<br>So what if sometimes you're unsure? You care so much about your parents! 
<br>I can feel your love every time I talk to you. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Madam, 
<br>
<br>I am still far from mature and can never repay my parents' selfless and generous deeds, 
<br>but I will always attempt to repay my debt.
<br>No matter how poor I am... I will always aid my parents... 
<br>Now I know again my true purpose!! This is all thanks to you, madam...! I shall see you at the party and show my immense gratitude! 
<br>
<br>Sincerely yours, John Doe, Member of the Pious Son Committee
<br></div></div></div><div>Be rich </div><div><div>Dear Mr. Doe, 
<br>
<br>Be rich of course!

<br>a bougie house with bougie furniture... Who wouldn't be happy with those? ;-)

<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Madam, 
<br>
<br>Uhm, I couldn't quite understand what you mean by 'bougie'. 
<br>It seems to me that you think my parents 
<br>only care about living a luxurious life. 
<br>Well, first, it is quite rude of you to assume that, 
<br>and second, after hearing your answer, I am certain than my health 
<br>matters much more to my parents than my wealth. Living a long life with my parents and sending them off in peace. 
<br>I am sure that is what a pious son must do... I'm no longer certain... that is is a good idea to attend the party...
<br>
<br>Sincerely yours, John Doe, Member of the Pious Son Committee
<br></div></div></div><div>Nietzsche </div><div><div>Dr. Mr. Doe,

<br>but I'm not sure he is the expert when it comes to filial piety...
<br>I think it was a philosopher from ancient China who said it.... but I don't really remember, so I suppose I can't say you are wrong.
<br>If there will only be people like you at the party... I will think about it again. 
<br>Have a peaceful day...

<br>We must be cautious of passion as at times it leads us to make unwise decisions...
<br>That was not what I was expecting at all... 
<br>My parents have always told me not to mix with the wrong crowd. I should not go to that party... 
<br>
<br>Sincerely yours, John Doe, Member of the Pious Son Committee

Yo RFA Rep, 

Hey, exuvwe my typos. mY hands aer hsaking fro m quiytin g smoking.
It's a bit better now. This is a serious problem... I haven't been in my right mind all day just thinking about smoking... 
Last time I had a pretty big presentation at work. I was holding one of those laser pointers and my hand started shaking for not having a cig during that short moment, and the whole room felt like a disco ball. I almost got fired because of that and decided to quit, but it's not working that well T_T I told my new girlfriend that I'd quit too...
I don't think I can go to the party like this. Please scold me so that I can quit smoking for the party at least!

<br>
<br>Hello! I am {0}, RFA's representative. 
<br>You want me to scold you...? I'm not sure if I'll do it right but... 
<br>They say that a man's word is his bond! If you've made a promise, you have to keep it! 
<br>If it's difficult to quit right away, why don't you try nicotine patches or candy? Small efforts will pile up and help you quit smoking!  
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>Yeah!! I'm gonna quit smoking!!! 
<br>
<br>....That's what I say but my hands aren't listening to me...T_T 
<br>I start rummaging my pants pockets, my shirt pockets, my bag, everywhere until I finally realize that I've quit...T_T 
<br>I don't think I'm in my right mind yet T_T Scold me more...T_T
<br>
<br>Dear New Member of Quit Smoking Support Group, 
<br></div></div></div><div>You're girlfriend will love that!</div><div><div>Dear New Member of Quit Smoking Support Group, 
<br>
<br>Oh you're girlfriend will just love that~! Won't she! You promised that you wouldn't smoke but you try to. 
<br>And your girlfriend might not like your breath smelling like cigarettes~ 
<br>Imagine. You two are just about to kiss and she tells you, "Babe, your breath smells like cigs." I mean, how awful would that be!? 
<br>Hang in there to protect your love! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>Omg... I didn't think about that T_T Still, I'm trying really hard though... I just have to go on like this, right? I'm doing good, right? 
<br>Maybe I can just have one cig... NOOOOOO WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME!? 
<br>Tell me I'm a horrible human being so that I don't ever think that again!! 
<br>
<br>Dear New Member of Quit Smoking Support Group, 
<br></div></div></div><div>You'll be useless if you give up now.</div><div><div>Dear New Member of Quit Smoking Support Group, 
<br>
<br>Are you in your right mind or not!? You've come this far. It'll all be over if you smoke that one cig! Wake up! 
<br>It's basically you almost reaching the top but just saying that you're gonna go down~! 
<br>You've done well till now, so just hang in there! Give a big fat kiss goodbye to smoking! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>I've been asking you to scold me and weird things like that, but thank you for actually doing it. 
<br>I could actually feel the anger this time... I'm wide awake now thanks to you. 
<br>I feel lighter, and the air tastes different. My girlfriend loves it. 
<br>I feel like I won't think about smoking for a long time now. See you at the party. 
<br>
<br>Dear New Member of Quit Smoking Support Group, 
<br></div></div></div><div>You're doing fine now :)</div><div><div>Dear New Member of Quit Smoking Support Group, 
<br>
<br>Why are you asking me to scold you? 
<br>You're doing good enough already :)
<br>Don't torture yourself too much~ 
<br>You're doing such a good job~!!
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>I think your compliments made me cocky...T_T 
<br>I suddenly came to my senses with a cig in my hands... 
<br>I did just smoke one, but do you think I can go to the party? Maybe my hands will start shaking again T_T 
<br>I feel like I just need to hold on a bit longer... I'll go to the party after seeing how I feel. 
<br>
<br>Dear New Member of Quit Smoking Support Group, 
<br></div></div></div><div>If it's that difficult, ask for your girlfriend's permission.</div><div><div>Dear New Member of Quit Smoking Support Group, 
<br>
<br>I think you're in too much pain. Maybe you might end up hurting yourself. 
<br>Ask permission from your girlfriend. She will understand! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>I gathered up my courage after reading your email and asked her if I could just smoke one cig. 
<br>But... she's not even taking my calls right now... She's disappointed...
<br>I asked you to scold me because I didn't want her to T_T You could have told me off! Gahh I don't know T_T... 
<br>I should just forget about the party and go beg for her forgiveness. 
<br>
<br>Dear New Member of Quit Smoking Support Group, 
<br></div></div></div><div>Me scolding you won't work. Just take it easy~</div><div><div>Dear New Member of Quit Smoking Support Group, 
<br>
<br>Hello. I'm {0}. 
<br>I heard that it's very hard to quit smoking. 
<br>Your body won't listen just because your mind is desperate. Of course not~ 
<br>If you could quit smoking just by getting scolded, then this group wouldn't have existed in the first place. Just take it easy! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>

Dear RFA Representative, 

Hi! I'm Lost Kang, I'm contacting instead of the leader. 
To briefly summarize our group, I guess we're just a bunch of struggling young people. 
We gather to talk about what we want to do, if what we're learning suits our personalities, if they're actually helpful and all that. 
People around me call me the golden boy. I have rich parents and I'm studying business at Hervard. 
I'm majoring in business to take over my dad's business, but I don't know what I really want to do. 

Best, Lost Kang, Member of the Wrong Majors Group
</div><div>What are you interested in these days. </div><div><div>Dear Lost Kang, 
<br>
<br>Hello, my name is {0}. I'm RFA's guest coordinator. 
<br>Let's think about all that together! What are you most interested in these days. 
<br>Anything that catches your eye or makes you happy! Let's start from there. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Hey {0},
<br>
<br>It's definitely not what I'm studying right now. It's not difficult or anything but it doesn't move me at all. 
<br>I'm actually kind of into fashion. I'm always interested in the next season color or items. I go to fabric stores to just look around. 
<br>I once got invited to a fashion show with my dad, and I was honestly kind of jealous at the designer who came out onto the runway after the show. 
<br>But I think it's too late for me to work in fashion... 
<br>
<br>Best, Lost 
<br></div></div></div><div>Who says you're late! You didn't even try. </div><div><div>Hi Lost, 
<br>
<br>Who ever said that you're late? 
<br>I think it's up to you to decide whether or not it's late. You already think you don't have a chance? 
<br>You're lost because you're doing what you don't like when you actually know what you want to do. 
<br>I'm sure you can just change your major and catch up with everything soon. Don't ignore what you like. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Hey {0},
<br>
<br>Yeah. I guess you're right... I just thought it was something I shouldn't do. 
<br>But I'm still a student... But do you think my family will let me? 
<br>I'm sure they thought I'd take over the family business. 
<br>
<br>Best, Lost
<br></div></div></div><div>Convince your parents, </div><div><div>Hi Lost, 
<br>
<br>Lost, have courage! This is the same thing! Don't be scared before you even give it a shot! 
<br>Of course, you'll have to work for it. Think through what you want and your future plans, and then tell your parents. 
<br>I can feel how sincere you are just by reading your emails, so I'm sure your parents will know. I'll be looking forward to hearing good news! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Hey {0}, 
<br>
<br>I was going to talk about the party, but I guess we're onto a whole different thing now, haha. 
<br>Still, I don't think this was useless at all. Thank you. 
<br>Thanks to you, I gathered up my courage to convince my parents. We agreed that I should take the test to transfer into the fashion school. 
<br>I'll thank you in person at the party. See you there. 
<br>
<br>Best, Lost
<br></div></div></div><div>Yeah... I guess since your parents are paying your tuition...</div><div><div>Hi Lost, 
<br>
<br>Come to think of it, that's true... Your parents are paying the tuition...
<br>Then I guess you should finish studying business. It's unfortunate, but what else can you do. 
<br>Just give up on changing your major for now. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Hey {0}, 
<br>
<br>Yeah I guess I can't overcome that one... but I finally feel like I know what I want. 
<br>I feel more complicated now... I need some time to organize my thought. 
<br>
<br>Best, Lost
<br></div></div></div><div>Yeah, I guess you are a bit late...</div><div><div>Dear Lost, 
<br>
<br>You are a bit late, I guess. Since other students probably started way before you. 
<br>Then maybe you can just major in business and manage a fashion company later on.
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Hey {0},
<br>
<br>Do you think I really can't get out of studying business? I feel like I'm starting wrong...
<br>That could be the right path... but I don't know. I'll decide after talking to the other members.
<br>
<br>Best, Lost
<br></div></div></div><div>This confusing period will pass. </div><div><div>Dear Lost Kang, 
<br>
<br>Hello. I'm {0}, RFA's party coordinator. 
<br>Everyone goes through a period where they are confused about their future. It's just a temporary phase. 
<br>But later on you will realize that your parents are always right. 
<br>It'll be better for your future to study business and take care of your GPA. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Hey {0}, 
<br>
<br>I'm kind of offended. You sound like you're belittling my issues. 
<br>And not just me but our whole group. 
<br>I'll tell the leader what you said.

Dear Charity Party Coordinator, 

Hello. 
I've stablished a research center for allergies. Allergies occur when a damaging immune response... Oh excuse me, 
I tend to explain everything in detail. 
I heard that there will be someone at the party who desperately needs my help. 
If you briefly explain which allergy that person is suffering from, I will be able to prepare for it beforehand. 
Sincerely, Head of Allergy Research Center
</div><div>Cat allergy</div><div><div>Dear Head of Allergy Research Center, 
<br>
<br>Hello! First, I'd like to thank you. 
<br>One of the hosts of this party suffers from a sever cat fur allergy.
<br>I heard that he can't stop crying and sneezing when he is around a cat. 
<br>And now he gets symptoms from just looking at photos of cats. 
<br>I'm sure not only mr friend, but also all the guests who have allergies will be very happy if you attend. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>He gets symptoms just by seeing a photo? Usually, cat allergies from cat saliva and protein... Oh, please excuse me again. Anyways, I'd like to study him myself. 
<br>But I have an allergy as well. Can I please know what kind of food you will be offering at the party? 
<br>I'm allergic to milk. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Head of Allergy Research Center
<br></div></div></div><div>Beef and seaweed soup</div><div><div>Dear Head of Allergy Research Center, 
<br>
<br>Please do not worry about your allergy! 
<br>We will prepare beef and seaweed soup, so that you can still consume protein and calcium without drinking milk. 
<br>Your email reminded me that I should ask other guests too if they have any allergies. 
<br>Thank you for the wonderful idea. :) 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>I see that you are well aware of the alternative food items for milk. Sometimes when I tell people that I am allergic to milk, they only cut out the milk and bring cheese. Food that doesn't contain milk... I will just stop here. 
<br>Come to think of it, I haven't heard anything about you. Do you have any allergies? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Head of Allergy Research Center
<br></div></div></div><div>I might be allergic to guests not attending the party.</div><div><div>Dear Head of Allergy Research Center, 
<br>
<br>I think I've developed an allergy while working for the party T_T
<br>I'm sort of allergic to guests not attending the party. Even now, when I think that you might not attend, 
<br>my nose and throat start feeling itchy. 
<br>Please come at least for me and help me! T_T
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Allergic to guests not attending the party? I've never heard of that before. 
<br>I think there's a need for me to meet you and do some tests. 
<br>I will go to the party with my test kit. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Head of Allergy Research Center
<br></div></div></div><div>I might be allergic to choice options. </div><div><div>Dear Head of Allergy Research Center, 
<br>
<br>Of course I do! Ever time I select one of the options, my eyes, nose, mouth, and start start feeling itchy. 
<br>I mean, there are so many options to choose from, and I feel like sneezing when I'm thinking hard about what to choose! 
<br>So I chose this. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Choice options? Do you need to choose something to write an email? 
<br>I'm not quite sure what you mean right now. 
<br>It'll be easy to find research on cat fur allergies, but regarding your allergy, I'll have to look up cases in other countries. If I can't come to the party, we can meet some other time. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Head of Allergy Research Center
<br></div></div></div><div>Cheese panini </div><div><div>Dear Head of Allergy Research Center, 
<br>
<br>I'm sad to hear that you have to give up milk. It's so delicious... 
<br>Then how about cheese panini? 
<br>I'll talk to the person in charge of catering and ask for extra cheese. That will make you feel better about not being able to drink milk. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>I guess you do not know what cheese is made of, or you simply forgot that cheese is also dairy. 
<br>Are you in charge of catering? If so, I might not be able to eat anything at the party. I will think about whether it will just be better to have the people suffering from allergies come to my center. If not, I will attend the party.  
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Head of Allergy Research Center
<br></div></div></div><div>There is no such person.</div><div><div>Dear Head of Allergy Research Center, 
<br>
<br>Hello! I'm {0}, the party's guest coordinator. 
<br>Fortunately, we don't have anyone who's suffering from allergies. 
<br>I don't know how that word got out, but I'll have to check that; 
<br>Still, if you are interested in the party, please come. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Party Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Is that so? I definitely heard that there's someone severely suffering from allergies...

Dear RFA Representative, 

I was contacted by Jaehee Kang to send you an email. I heard someone didn't have a good idea of what saving is, and needed my help... 
I was very curious of that person and that is why I'm sending you this email. 
In order to save, you will need basic capital and that capital can be accumulated through saving. 
"Wealth begins with saving" is my motto. You really need to set the habit when you are young. 
I heard that in Korea, people receive cash gifts on New Years day. People told me that was young people's biggest source of income... 
How did you manage your cash gifts? 

Sincerely, Frank, Finance Expert
</div><div>All to the bank! </div><div><div>Dear King of Savings Frank, 
<br>
<br>Hello, my name is {0}. 
<br>There is someone very unique in the RFA. I can say that he is the exact opposite of you when it comes to finance. 
<br>So I'm very curious how your conversation will go with him at the party. 
<br>I've always saved my money in my bank account ever since I was little. So I have quite a lot saved now! 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0},
<br>
<br>Opposite of me? I'm very curious. So he does not save any money? 
<br>I think we'll have an interesting debate. But I'm sure I will be right in the end. 
<br>Unless he is the Chairman of a top corporate, my theory will work. 
<br>I'm sure you see my photo. Can you guess what is in my pocket? 
<br>To give you a hint... it is very closely related to how I became the King of Savings. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Frank, Finance Expert
<br></div></div></div><div>Bank passbook</div><div><div>Dear King of Savings Frank, 
<br>
<br>I can kind of guess it. You said your first email that wealth begins with saving. 
<br>I think you have your savings account passbook in your pocket. 
<br>I feel like you always keep it close and remind yourself the importance of saving. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>I'm sure it was very obvious but you are correct. 
<br>I still have all of my bank passbooks, even the very first one I made. 
<br>I feel comfortable keeping it close to me... and as you said, I never want to forget the importance of saving. 
<br>When a risky venture comes in my way, I touch my passbooks and wake up. 
<br>How do you manage the funds for the party? As I just said, especially the account passbooks. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Finance Expert Frank
<br></div></div></div><div>We split it up. </div><div><div>Dear King of Savings Frank, 
<br>
<br>I'm in charge of managing the guests so I don't know the exact details. 
<br>But considering Jaehee and Jumin's personalities... I doubt they'll just put it in one bank account. 
<br>They'll probably have one account for the budget, one for emergency, and one for the donations... I think they split the funds into several accounts and manage them.
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0},
<br>
<br>If you are right, then RFA has a very strong foundation. 
<br>I've seen organizations that put their funds to personal bank accounts, and become confused on whether or not it's for their personal use. 
<br>I've always thought that the foundation of an organization is splitting the funds according to the purpose and saving... so RFA is right up my alley. 
<br>And I'm still very curious of the person who's the exact opposite of me. I'm very excited for the party. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Finance Expert Frank
<br></div></div></div><div>We put them all in one bank account. </div><div><div>Dear King of Savings Frank, 
<br>
<br>Hmm... I haven't asked about that yet. But I think they'll just put all the funds into the leader's personal bank account? 
<br>It'll be complicated to split it up into several accounts, so I think that's what they do. 
<br>And it'll be more convenient to look at later. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div></div></div></div><div>Leprechaun's pot of gold! </div><div><div>Dear King of Savings Frank, 
<br>
<br>If it's related to you being the King of Savings... then I'm sure it's because you have a lot of money. Now where does that money come from... 
<br>A leprechaun's pot of gold! A pot that endlessly produces gold coins... 
<br>How about it? I'm right, right?? 
<br>
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>A leprechaun's pot of gold... That is a funny idea. 
<br>But will the world be a happy place if that exists? Or will it suffer from inflation? 
<br>Even if I had such an item, I would have kept on saving, but that's the not the answer. I think you should read my first email again. 
<br>My assistant is telling me that my schedule is very full. 
<br>If I can manage to adjust my schedule, I will go to the party. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Finance Expert Frank
<br></div></div></div><div>I just gave it to my mom. </div><div><div>Dear King of Savings Frank, 
<br>
<br>Hello Frank! My name is {0}. 
<br>I always gave my gash gifts to my mom. She always told me that I might lose it so that I should give it to her.  
<br>I'm sure she saved them. I never checked but I'm sure she has. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>It's good that you trust your mother... But from a finance expert's perspective, that is not a good option. 
<br>You should start the habit of saving right now if you can. Save your money not in your mother's pocket, but in your bank account. 
<br>I thought the organization seemed interesting so I wanted to attend the party... but my assistant tells me my schedule is full. 
<br>I will have to see you at the next party. I hope it is a success. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Frank, Finance Expert

Dear RFA Represtentative, 

Hey what's up? ...Uhm... Are you a girl? Then do you...
No no, this is not a blind date! I don't think I'll ever quit from the Forever Alone Association
Unlike all other organizations, members are sad when they join and become happy when they leave T_T 
Chulsoo finally set up a date for me, but I'm sure I'll just mess it up... What do you think my first text should be to her? 

Best, Youngsoo, Member of Forever Alone Association 
</div><div>Hi, I'm Youngsoo. I got your number through Chulsoo. </div><div><div>Dear Youngsoo, 
<br>
<br>Hello! I'm {0}, RFA's party coordinator. 
<br>People always say that first impressions are very important. So I'm sure that first text will be crucial. 
<br>Don't ever say start off your text by what you said in your email to me! 
<br>You should sound polite, so start by saying "Hi, I'm Youngsoo. I got your number through Chulsoo." And then set a time and place to meet. Don't sound too casual or use a bunch of emojis. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div> 
<br>Dear {0}
<br>
<br>All this time, I've always said "Yo! What's up? lolol This is Youngsoo, Chulsoo's friend lololololol But can u send me a photo first?" 
<br>Come to think of it, the people who showed up after seeing that text were just being super nice...T_T 
<br>I did learn some things, so I thought really hard about what to wear! I think a shirt and black pants would be the best outfit, but I think it's too simple. 
<br>What should I wear as an accessory? 
<br>
<br>Best, Youngsoo who wants to quit the FAA 
<br></div></div></div><div>Wear a watch! </div><div><div>Dear Youngsoo, 
<br>
<br>I think as an accessory, you should just wear a watch and make everything simple. 
<br>They say that too much is as bad as none at all. If wear too many things, you'll just seem like a try hard. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>A watch as my accessory. I'll definitely keep my outfit simple on the date! Thanks {0}! 
<br>Text check, outfit check... I guess I can get a girlfriend now? 
<br>If she comes to the date, I'm just going to ask her to be my girlfriend there! 
<br>
<br>Best, Youngsoo who desperately wants to quit the FAA
<br></div></div></div><div>Asking is not a challenge but a confirmation. </div><div><div>Dear Youngsoo, 
<br>
<br>Youngsoo! You can't go that fast. Asking someone to be your girlfriend is not a challenge but a confirmation! 
<br>The person will feel very uncomfortable if you don't consider her feelings too, so don't ask her to be your girlfriend on your first date! ><
<br>
<br>Best, {0} who believes Youngsoo can soon leave the FAA 
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0} to whom I'm greatly indebted to, 
<br>
<br>Now I know how wrong I was until now T_T I sent her the text just as you told me to and she seemed really pleased!
<br>I have a lot more confidence now! Thanks to you I think I can finally quit this group!! 
<br>I'll definitely see you at the party. I hope I can tell you there that I have a girlfriend! See you then!
<br>
<br>Best, Youngsoo who's likely to get a girlfriend soon
<br></div></div></div><div>The moment you lay eyes on her! Girlfriend first dating next. </div><div><div>Dear Youngsoo, 
<br>
<br>They say that only those with courage get the ladies. 
<br>Just do it when you get the feeling! Be my girlfriend! We can get to know each other later on! Just shout it out loud.
<br>Don't hesitate and just do it! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>I'm texting with the girl who I'm going on the date with and she seemed to like me. So I just took your advice and asked her to be my girlfriend...
<br>But she never answered... I think I must have done something wrong...
<br>But it's not all bad news! I got another date. 
<br>I still think it's more important for me to get a girlfriend than to go on the party. If it coincides with my date, I probably won't be able to go T_T 
<br>Still, thanks for helping {0}!
<br>
<br>Best, Youngsoo, Member of FAA
<br></div></div></div><div>A beret</div><div><div>Dear Youngsoo, 
<br>
<br>Since you're wearing simple clothes, you should add some va va voom! Why don't you wear a beret to spice up your hairstyle? 
<br>I'm sure you'll be memorable. I really love people who wear berets. 
<br>I'm sure she'll fall in love with you on the spot. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>A beret? Are you trying to make fun of me? 
<br>I don't have a lot of experience, but I do know that Canadian tuxedos, gold chains, bro tanks, and berets are complete disasters for dates! 
<br>I asked for your help...T_T You're just joking right? I'll have to think about whether or not to go to the party... 
<br>
<br>Best, Youngsoo, Member of FAA 
<br></div></div></div><div>( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Hey hon... wanna hang with me? </div><div><div>Dear Youngsoo, 
<br>Hello! I'm {0}, RFA's party coordinator. 
<br>The first text is always hard... I think it's nice to be friendly and use a lot of emojis. Just send her what I wrote down below!  
<br>“( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Hey hun~ I'm Youngsoo lolol U can call me hon too lolol
<br>What does my babe wanna eat? Ur not the bougie type, r u? How about McMonalds? lolol" 
<br>I'm sure you'll score if you send this >.O!
<br>
<br>Best {0}, 
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}
<br>
<br>Uhm so... I sent that text... and my friend who set up the date got really mad asking what I was thinking... 
<br>He's not going to set up any dates for me now... This is all your fault. 
<br>You just wanted me to stay a forever alone, right? I'm not gonna go to the party!! 
<br>

Super Special Discount Lamb Skewers Restaurant

You're craving lamb skewers today, and you wanna go somewhere offering a discount. Where do you go?  Go to... Oops. Totally thought I was sending out a marketing email. Sorry lolol
Hyun told me there was going to be a party and to email you? We used always go on rides and get chased by cops, and now he's throwing a huge party! Can't believe it lolol
You really never know, do you? Well, I guess I never knew I'd open up a lamb skewers restaurant some day...  
I'd like to go to the party, but sometimes I get rude customers... They hit the waiters and curse... I don't know if I can leave the place... 
I might go if you tell me how to deal with those type of customers. I'll check your answer I finish grilling the meat. 

-Haejung
</div><div>Call the police! </div><div><div>Dear Haejung, 
<br>
<br>Hello, I'm {0}. I'm in charge of managing the guests. 
<br>Zen told me you're an old friend of his! It would be great if you could tell me how you two got to know each other at the party :)
<br>If you're having trouble with rude customers... you can just call the police and ask for help. You won't have to get into fights with them then. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Hey {0}
<br>
<br>Zen? Oh, you mean Hyun~ That name kind of makes me cringe. lolololol Next time I see him, I should call him Zen the actor, haha.
<br>But the police... that's not a bad idea, but when I see the cops, I don't know why but I just hide lolololol
<br>Maybe because I was reckless and in a motorcycle gang when I was young. Still, I guess I should get used to that now. 
<br>Oh, sorry. I have a customer. I'll check your email later. 
<br>
<br>-Haejung
<br></div></div></div><div>Say hello! </div><div><div>Dear Haejung, 
<br>
<br>Zen told me that you're over that life now! 
<br>The Haejung who's talking with me isn't doing anything bad. 
<br>It's not as if "reckless teen in motorcycle gang" is written on your forehead, so don't be scared, and why don't you start with saying hello? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>You're totally right lolol It's such a basic thing but I didn't even think about it. 
<br>I guess old habits die hard. I'll try when I see one next time. 
<br>Hi Mr. policeman, please take good care of us~ I guess that's what I should say? Anyways, I get it now. 
<br>But my instincts kick in when I see another type too. Kids who sit around the streets trying to take other people's money. 
<br>How do you think I'd react when I see kids like that? 
<br>
<br>-Haejung
<br></div></div></div><div>I think you'll give them a kick in the butt. </div><div><div>Dear Haejung, 
<br>
<br>I think you'll give them a kick in the butt, not literally of course. You're tough so I don't think you'll just let those kids go. 
<br>And Zen told me that you use your profits to guide children to good places. 
<br>That's my guess. Am I right? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>Yup! You're totally right! 
<br>Some people tell me that I'm just being nosy and kids can get really scary these days lololol 
<br>But I was in their shoes once so I can't just give up on them. 
<br>I know how hard it is to come back to the right path. 
<br>Of course, a lot of kids try to rebel against me, but my instincts just won't let them be haha :) 
<br>I haven't seen Hyun in a while, and now that I know how to deal with rude customers, I guess I can leave the place for a day. Then see you at the party. 
<br>
<br>-Haejung
<br></div></div></div><div>I think you'll just look down on the ground and pass by. </div><div><div>Dear Haejung, 
<br>
<br>Hmm, I think you'll just look down on the ground and pass by. 
<br>You're no longer in a motorcycle gang, and you're a proper owner of a restaurant. 
<br>But even if you are still in a gang, those kids would be scary. They're like land mines on the street. 
<br>Best is not to touch them. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>You think I'd be scared of those kids? No way! 
<br>I'm more afraid of police car sirens chasing me! 
<br>Once you head the wrong path, it's so hard to come back. It's up to the adults to leave them back for them to feel less regret later on. 
<br>Anyways, I keep getting orders in the restaurant so I'll have to think. Party or reservations? I'll think about it and decide! 
<br>
<br>-Haejung
<br></div></div></div><div>Run away! </div><div><div>Dear Haejung, 
<br>
<br>Don't policeman just kind of make you nervous? 
<br>I feel like you'll feel more guilty though. Right? lololol
<br>I think it's just better to run away than stay and get into trouble. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>I just saw a cop outside the restaurant and started running away just like you said, and he started chasing me like crazy!!! 
<br>I barely explained everything and came back inside. But I feel like I have a trauma! 
<br>Hyun said he wanted me to come because he wants a variety of people there. Are cops gonna be there? 
<br>I think I'll just stay here and watch over the restaurant;;; 
<br>
<br>-Haejung
<br></div></div></div><div>Threaten them with your skewers! </div><div><div>Dear Haejung, 
<br>
<br>Hello, Haejung. Zen told me a lot about you. 
<br>Rude customers? I'm sure that's just trouble. I mean, is there a need to be nice to them? 
<br>Just hold your skewers and scare them. I guess they'll never be rude after that. 
<br>And I think you're kind of used to doing things like that, right? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear {0}, 
<br>
<br>That's just violence;; I was in a motorcycle gang, but I never hurt anyone. 
<br>Did Hyun tell you that I'm violent? I feel really betrayed. 
<br>Forget about the party. I should talk to Hyun first.

Dear RFA Representative, 

Oh my, I heard there's going to be fantastic event! Of course I have to go to the party. Just the place for me! 
Don't worry about gathering strangers. If I go, everyone will leave the place in couples. 
And if your significant other isn't there, I can just keep you in mind and introduce a better partner. 
But how about you, miss? Do you have some time in your life? I don't want to pry or anything~ I just want to know what you do. 
Then it's easier for me to find a good partner for you. 

-Psychic Moon, Matchmaker of Love 
</div><div>So much time! </div><div><div>Dear Psychic Moon, 
<br>
<br>Hello, I'm {0}. 
<br>I rarely had guests who said they would attend straight away. Thank you so much :)
<br>I have so much money... Totally joking... But I do have a lot of time. 
<br>Although I am quite busy preparing for the party. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>That's just perfect. You can't buy time with money. And you need time to date someone. 
<br>I'll make a note of this info and listen to the rest at the party. 
<br>Who your ideal type is, how much you earn, what you do, and all that. Don't be shy~ The more you open up to me, the better man you will find! 
<br>We'll talk about my fees that day too :) But don't you have anyone else around you? Someone who's rich. 
<br>
<br>-Psychic Moon, Matchmaker of Love 
<br></div></div></div><div>C&R Director</div><div><div>Dear Psychic Moon, 
<br>
<br>I do know someone but I sort of just met him. 
<br>I don't know if he's interested in dating, but there is one person who meets your criteria. 
<br>C&R Director Jumin Han... How about it? Is he okay? He's the boss of Jaehee Kang, the one you said was impossible to matchmake. 
<br>He will be attending the party as well!
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>Did I read right? C&R?????? 
<br>Oh my this is not just fine. He's not even class A, he's class A+++! Why didn't Miss Kang mention that? 
<br>My phone will ring nonstop if people know I can match them with Director Han! 
<br>I'll make sure to attend that party, even if I have to break a leg. Such a good day to score a jackpot, I mean, to find love~
<br>
<br>But you know, kids these days stare at me as if I'm some strange person if I tell them I'm a matchmaker. 
<br>I really just want to find people true love. Do you know the old mythological figure related to matchmaking? 
<br>
<br>-Psychic Moon, Matchmaker of Love 
<br></div></div></div><div>Old man under the moon.</div><div><div>Dear Psychic Moon, 
<br>
<br>You mean the old man under the moon, right? I know of him :) 
<br>He appears at night to unite all predestined couples with a silken cord and that will ensure their union! 
<br>Should I call you woman with the emails, then? You're working so hard to unite destined couples through emails like this :) 
<br>I'm sure you'll do a great job at helping destined ones find each other.
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>Oh yes, of course! You are such a nice girl! I'll make sure to find a man above class A for you! 
<br>Well, I'll be nice. I'll give you a discount on the matchmaking fee too. I don't usually run my business this way but you are just too nice. 
<br>I think I'll get a couple more clients at the party. Let's fine the perfect man for you there~ 
<br>
<br>-Psychic Moon, Matchmaker of Love 
<br></div></div></div><div>Old man under the sun.</div><div><div>Dear Psychic Moon, 
<br>
<br>Of course I know. You mean the old man under the sun, right? 
<br>The old man who randomly connected people under the sun and happened to be right? 
<br>I guess we can call you woman under the sun then ^0^
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>Oh my... What are you talking about, girl? You were right about the old man... but the rest is rubbish! 
<br>Matchmakers never make random selections... 
<br>Isn't that the worst description for me? I'm very good at making the right choices :)
<br>I think it'll better for me to find someone who's on the same page... I'll have to think about this again @>----

<br>Will that party help me? I might not be able to attend, so please make a note~

Dear RFA Party Coordinator, 

Hello, I'm Chef RamG. I hope you don't waste my time. 
I don't need to hear any pathetic explanations, so just answer my questions!!!! Alright??!!!!
A very, very easy question. I'll go ballistic if you can't answer. So choose wisely. 
How many cups of water do you need when making ramen? 

-Chef RamG 
</div><div>3 cups, chef. </div><div><div>Dear Chef RamG, 
<br>
<br>Yes, chef. 
<br>Hello, my name is {0}. 
<br>For one portion of ramen, 3 cups is appropriate. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>I don't care about your name! 
<br>I'll let you go this time because you got it right, but next time, I won't even give you a chance to answer. 
<br>But 3 cups of water is the perfect amount. Very harmonious. 
<br>This isn't it. Are you interested in desserts? You'd better be. 
<br>I'm sure you know that the dough is crucial in baking cookies. Do you know what to do when you want crispy cookies? 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>-Chef RamG
<br></div></div></div><div>You mix as if you're cutting, chef.</div><div><div>Dear Chef RamG
<br>
<br>Yes chef, you mix as if you're cutting. 
<br>Kneading the dough will make the cookies hard, so you have to mix with the spatula as if you are cutting the dough. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>So you know the basics. Some people keep on kneading because they saw it on a cartoon, 
<br>and obviously they don't care about their teeth. Or maybe theirs are made of steel. 
<br>Next question. Do you know how long it takes to perfectly steam crab? 
<br>
<br>-Chef RamG
<br></div></div></div><div>20 minutes</div><div><div>Dear Chef RamG, 
<br>
<br>Yes chef, it's 20 minutes. You thoroughly clean the crab, and put it upside down in the steamer so that the juice doesn't drip. 
<br>I heard it's good to leave it in the steamer for an extra five minutes after turning off the fire. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>You are correct. Very nice job. You're different from all the other party coordinators I've met until now. 
<br>I hope my employees learn from you. I almost want to offer you a job at one of my restaurants. 
<br>I'll be very disappointed if the party serves bad food, but I trust that won't be the case. 
<br>
<br>-Chef RamG
<br></div></div></div><div>5 minutes, chef</div><div><div>Dear Chef RamG, 
<br>
<br>It's five minutes, chef. 
<br>You put it upside down in the steamer, leave the lid open, and steam for 5 minutes. The fishy smell will be gone then.
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>What?? Lid open? 5 minutes? 
<br>That crab won't cook and run back to the ocean to sing songs to Little Mermaid!!!! IT WON'T COOK!!!! 
<br>I'd have kicked you out through the back door if you did that in my kitchen. Be thankful that you're not. 
<br>We won't have steamed crab at the party, right? No, I can't trust you. Send me the menu later. I'll decide whether to attend after that.
<br>
<br>-Chef RamG
<br></div></div></div><div>You thoroughly knead the dough, chef. </div><div><div>Dear Chef RamG, 
<br>
<br>You have to thoroughly knead the dough to bake delicious cookies. 
<br>The more you knead, the more you will be able to produce crispy and light cookies. 
<br>
<br>Sincere, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>Crispy??!!!!! Did you just say crispy?!!! You mean crunch!!! THE SOUND OF YOUR TEETH BRAKING!!!! 
<br>Cookies made that way will be so hard they can be put into bulletproof vests!! 
<br>You'll be able to get a job in the munitions business right away. NEW BULLETPROOF VESTS MADE OUT OF COOKIES! 
<br>I hope the party serves cookies you've made. I'll have to think more about attending for the sake of my teeth. 
<br>

<br>Hello. I'm {0}, RFA's guest coordinator. 
<br>I'm pretty good at making ramen. I pride myself in being the world's best when it comes to adding the right amount of water. 
<br>It'll be very delicious if you put three cups first and then another three cups later. 
<br>I think even 3 michelin star chefs can be unskilled when it comes to instant noodles :) 
<br>Don't be shy >< We all learn this way! If you come to the party, I'll make you a bowl of ramen myself.
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>World's best???? You mean the world's best *@$%&XXXX idiot?? 
<br>6 cups???? With that much water in your pot, you could hold a swim competition there!!!! 
<br>And you want to give that to me? That's not being kind, that's torture. I won't go to the party!!

Dear RFA Representative, 


It would have been so nice if the invitation was hand-written. 
I'm quite sad that young people these days do not handwrite things. 
In each handwritten word is affection and the writer's personality. 
A pen is very crucial in the enjoyment of writing by hand, and well, BIC is the best in that. 
Of course, it all depends on personal taste. 
You must also prefer some pens more than others. I'd like to hear which brand you enjoy. 


Sincerely, Pen Hemingway, CEO of BIC

</div><div>The best of all pens in the nation, BIC. </div><div><div>Dear Mr. Hemingway, 
<br>
<br>Hello, Mr. Hemingway! I'm {0}. 
<br>I would love for you to come to our party. I'm sure all the members are looking forward to meeting you. 
<br>I love BIC pens the best! They are great quality, but very affordable. And they have a long history, so they feel familiar. 
<br>We won't have pens at the party, but I always use BIC pens! 
<br>
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>I see you've been a long time pen, I mean fan, of ours. I hope you continue to enjoy them. 
<br>But last time, I held a seminar on the topic, "How did we become the world's most used pen?", 
<br>and one student asked me, "You must know a lot about pens, if you own the company. Can you please tell me how I can use one for a long time?"
<br>That's what she asked. To be honest, in terms of business, it'd be right for me to tell her to just buy a new one. 
<br>I was very embarrassed that I had to brush over that question. What would you have said? 
<br>
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Pen Hemingway, CEO of BIC
<br></div></div></div><div>"Sear the end with a lighter."</div><div><div>Dear Mr. Hemingway, 
<br>
<br>Oh no, it must have been difficult. I would have told her, "Sear the end with a lighter."
<br>It truly works so you wouldn't have lied, 
<br>and since lighters can be dangerous, you could add that it might just be safer to buy a new one. People wouldn't be turned off that way. 
<br>Then you can answer a customer's question, and market your product. One bird with two stones. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>That would have worked. You sound very wise. 
<br>I think when you say BIC, you think of a black head with white penholder", a signature color and design of ours. 
<br>But it is a controversy within the company on whether we can still insist on the same design in this day and age. Do you think it'll be better to change it? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Pen Hemingway, CEO of BIC
<br></div></div></div><div>Classic is best. </div><div><div>Dear Mr. Hemingway, 
<br>
<br>I am against the change!
<br>As you've said, the design is almost symbolic of the brand. I don't think you should change it. 
<br>The company may come out with new products, but I wouldn't discontinue the one it currently offers. 
<br>I also think you may lose customers who were fond of the classic design. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>I knew it. I will make sure to tell everyone your opinion at the next meeting. 
<br>I don't know what the result will be, but honestly, I strongly agree. 
<br>Since I decided on the design... 
<br>I originally planned to ask you a couple things about the party, but that seems unnecessary after talking with you. 
<br>Then I will be at the party. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Pen Hemingway, CEO of BIC
<br></div></div></div><div>How about a design similar to Monc Blant? </div><div><div>Dear Mr. Hemingway, 
<br>
<br>Wow, I think you should give a bonus to the person who suggested the change! 
<br>I thought design was always the one thing that the BIC pen could improve in.
<br>I don't know who'd still insist on that design lololol I mean, it's kind of lame. 
<br>I've always admired how the Monc Blant fountain pens look. Why don't you copy that design? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>I was the one who decided on that design, so hearing your opinion disappoints me a little. 
<br>Still, I cannot ignore a customer's opinion just because I don't like it, so I will mention it during a meeting. 
<br>If we come up with the new design before the party, I will show you.  
<br>Then I have to go attend an all nighter meeting with the development department. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Pen Hemingway, CEO of BIC
<br></div></div></div><div>"You can change the ball on the pen's tip."</div><div><div>Dear Mr. Hemingway, 
<br>
<br>I thought a CEO of a large pen company would know, but I guess this one, you don't! 
<br>The life of a ballpoint pen is the ink and the ball. If the ink isn't the issue, you have to exchange the ball. 
<br>You can just take out the ball from a pen you don't use and put it in there. 
<br>That's what you can say at your next seminar :) 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>The ball on the tip is very small so it's almost impossible for a person to change it. 
<br>I didn't have a good answer to give, but I think I know a bit more about the structure of a pen than you do. 
<br>I will have to talk about this with my team to come up with an answer.
<br>I have to find one before my next seminar... so I don't know if I will be able to attend. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Pen Hemingway, CEO of BIC
<br></div></div></div><div>Chebra pen made overseas.  </div><div><div>Dear Mr. Hemingway, 
<br>
<br>Hello. I also love writing by hand, so I agree with everything you said. 
<br>I only use Chebra pens. As you know, they just produce better pens! 
<br>You have to admit the truth! And I feel like they're cooler, because they're made overseas. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Representative, 
<br>
<br>Hmm.... I think the quality is the same... but that is very shocking to hear. 
<br>I don't feel like meeting anyone for a while, so I will not attend this party. 
<br>

Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 

People say that people who win with stock investment lose with stock investment... right? I don't believe in that. 
Stock investment never betrays me. Do you know what people who invest in stocks often say? 
What to do when you hate someone, when you want to get revenge.... 

Best, Knowit All 
</div><div>Tell them to invest in stocks. </div><div><div>Dear Mr. All, 
<br>
<br>Hello, Mr. All! I'm {0}, RFA's guest coordinator. 
<br>I don't know what you'd think if you hear this since you're so well versed in stocks...
<br>But I heard you can just tell that person to invest in stocks. Since if you don't really know the market, it's very easy to lose money. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div> 
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Haha... I never intended it, but I did that too. 
<br>Last time, I met a person who used to bully me at school, and he changed his attitude towards me after hearing I got rich through stocks. 
<br>He kept asking me, so I gave him a couple tips. I didn't give him any false info. But... that friend... hahaha... 
<br>I just told him to keep the most important rule, and I guess he just got greedy and forgot it. Do you know what that rule is, {0}? 
<br>
<br>Best, Knowit All 
<br></div></div></div><div>Not losing your money. </div><div><div>Dear Mr. All, 
<br>
<br>The rule is not to get greedy and lose your money. 
<br>If you get greedy and invest all-in, instead of the magic that turns 1 mill to 2 mill, you'll be cursed with it turning to 0. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>You're right. 
<br>You know what the most important rule is. Greed is a sin. You can only figure out the right time to buy and sell if you get rid of your greed. That's the philosophy of stock investment. 
<br>People always hear the word "rich" and make unreasonable investments. 
<br>If you really want to do it, you have to be interested in world issues and economies, and research the company you're interested in. Will there be people at the party who know those things very well? 
<br>
<br>Best, Knowit All 
<br></div></div></div><div>Chief Assistant Jaehee Kang. </div><div><div>Dear Mr. All, 
<br>
<br>Of course. Chief Assistang Jaehee Kang who works for C&R's Director Jumin Han will be there. She knows everything about the company. Without her all-nighters, Mr. Han might not be at the place he is right now! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Oh, if such a person will be there, I must attend. I'm very angry at the moment because some strange hacker stole my email address... Never thought I'd get to attend such a golden party! 
<br>See you there. 
<br>
<br>Best, Knowit All 
<br></div></div></div><div>Yoosung Kim who entered a prestigious university </div><div><div>Dear Mr. All, 
<br>
<br>One of the RFA members is Yoosung Kim who entered the prestigious H University. He's also ranked number 2 on the Shooting Star server at LOLOL, so he's definitely smart. 
<br>Why don't you ask him to analyze the hyperbolic function at the party? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Ranked number 2 on the LOLOL Shooting Star server... I know him. The stock market closes at 3 so afterwards I don't have much to do but play games. 
<br>Superman Yoosung is famous in the LOLOL world as being a pushover for purchasing the Solider's Spear at a high price and selling it for nothing. Hmm... I'll have to think again about attending the party...  
<br>
<br>Bye. 
<br>
<br>Best, Knowit All
<br></div></div></div><div>Getting rich. </div><div><div>Dear Mr. All, 
<br>
<br>Isn't stock investment and the lottery the same thing? You have to get rich to be like you, the stock legend! Hahaha! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>That's not true. Greed for money only makes people invest all-in or believe false rumors. Then losing your entire savings is only a matter of time. 
<br>The basic attitude towards stock investment is the thought that you have enough money. And then you come up with your own philosophy and strategies. 
<br>I'll have to teach the very basics... I'll reconsider attending the party. 
<br>
<br>Best, Knowit All 
<br></div></div></div><div>Don't give them bait. Just ignore those people! </div><div><div>Dear Mr. All, 
<br>
<br>Just ignore people like that! There are so many things to care about in this world. You should just ignore they exist. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>...You do not have the attitude to join battle. 
<br>The stock market will open soon so I have to go.

I'm Jack Kim,the  moooooost famous person in the naming industry! Call me Mr. Choi
Everyone becomes happy when I give them their name! Just leave them all to me! I'll give you a name that holds the spirit of the universe!! 
But I don't have a lot of work these days... I, I mean, that's not my main cause! I'm quite interested in the party as I'll get the chance to get my name out there for those who need a name... 
I'll have to prepare a lot to go! But I can't come up with a unique name. Can you suggest one for me? 

-Mr. Choi
</div><div>Luciel</div><div><div>Dear Mr. Kim, 
<br>
<br>Hello, Jack... I mean, Mr. Choi! I'm {0}. 
<br>I wondered who you are after Yoosung told me about you! I have noticed that people are searching for more unique names these days. 
<br>Hmm.... if I think about the unique ones I've heard recently... Luciel! How about it? 
<br>I think it's a very unique and memorable name! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Luciel... I've never heard of it! Very unique! I think it will be perfect for young people these days! 
<br>The names I was thinking of were Yoosung, Jumin, Hyun, and such, so that was it... 
<br>But now i have one that's unique... so now I need one that's pretty. If you ask me what the difference is between a unique name and a pretty name... 
<br>I can't really explain. I just know when I hear a pretty name... I just know it! I'm the standard! If the god of naming thinks it's pretty, then it's pretty! 
<br>

<br></div></div></div><div>{0}</div><div><div>Dear Mr. Choi,

<br>I'm glad you like the name I suggested. This is all my... I mean, if I'm to be exact, an RFA member's doing :)
<br>If you're looking for a pretty name... I'm a bit embarrassed to say it, but how about {0}...? 
<br>I always hear compliments on my name, and I like it too! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>To be honest, I thought your name is very pretty the first time I read it! 
<br>It's a fantastic name. The one who gave you that name is... almost as good as I am. 
<br>Of course, I won't give this name to just anyone! I'll give it to someone who suits it, so don't worry! 
<br>Now that I have a unique and pretty name, I can attend the party!.... Or not... To be honest... 
<br>That university asked me to name another bunny... if you help me with this again, I'll definitely be able to attend!
<br>
<br>-Mr. Choi
<br></div></div></div><div>Jihae</div><div><div>Dear Mr. Choi, 
<br>
<br>A name for a bunny? I can think of one right now! How about Jihae? 
<br>Omg!! 
<br>This sentence, "My lady, you look so beautiful gaming," I mean, "drawing" suddenly flashed into my head! 
<br>This is it! I think it will be perfect!

<br>
<br>What? Flashed into your head? 
<br>
<br>I thought that too! Jihae... Such a good name!!! 
<br>The names Jiwoo and Jieun have come to me as well! This is three birds with one stone!! 
<br>I'll be able to name more bunnies if they come along, so I'll be able to go to the party. 
<br>A lot of people might come to me because I'm so famous. So make sure everything's good. Then see you then!

Dear RFA Customer, 

You don't know what to eat today? Hahaha
We have fried chicken, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, 
sweet and sour chicken that will fire up your taste buds, 
and teriyaki chicken, that you will never forget. 
Call VFC When you watch some chicken~! 800-XXX-XXXX

Haha, this isn't a spam mail, so I hope you haven't erased it... 
I'm the owner of VFC, and I pride myself in never using the same oil twice. 
Now there's a chicken place every block. You're curious of how we're still in business? 
It's because we not only care about the taste, but also marketing... It's a commercial targeting young people, do you know? 

Call VFC When you watch some chicken~! 800-XXX-XXXX
Sincerely, Owner of VFC 
</div><div>I saw it on Youtube! </div><div><div>Dear Owner of VFC,

<br>Hello, I'm so happy to meet someone who's succeeded a fried chicken business, my favorite food! 
<br>I'm {0}, and I'm RFA's guest coordinator. 
<br>I think I saw the commercial on Youtube! I couldn't stop replying it. 
<br>The first 15 seconds, I was forced to watch, but the song was so catchy I just couldn't skip! 
<br>Please don't change the song~

<br></div><div>
<br>Dear customer {0},
<br>
<br>Thank you for the compliment. If only I knew your address I would have sent over a 12 piece right away... 
<br>I'm glad the song is effective. It was worth the research, hahaha. 
<br>Next time, we want to change our mascot. Do you have any suggestions? 
<br>
<br>Call 800-XXX-XXXA if you want your own VFC~! 
<br>Sincerely, Owner of VKC
<br></div></div></div><div>The face of a generous looking grandfa.... I mean, you, the owner! </div><div><div>Dear Owner of VFC, 
<br>
<br>The mascot is practically the brand's face! So many places are already using chickens as their mascot. 
<br>To give the customers a trustworthy impression, why don't you use a grandfa... I mean, your face? :)  
<br>I think that will say, "I'm the one who's frying your chicken. Trust me and enjoy it." Good, isn't it? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div> 
<br>Dear customer {0}, 
<br>
<br>Haha, my face? The birth of the generous VFC grandfather... I think we should have every store put a life size figurine of me in front. 
<br>Now that I have marketing taken care of, it's time to improve the basics, the taste! 
<br>So we're currently developing two items. I'd like to hear your opinion. 
<br>One is fried chicken with cheese sprinkled on top, and one is fried chicken covered in fruit flavored sprinkles.
<br>Which one do you prefer? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Owner of VFC
<br></div></div></div><div>Cheese is the way of the world! </div><div><div>Dear Owner of VFC, 
<br>
<br>Cheese! I don't think anyone dislikes cheese. 
<br>I'm sure they will taste great together. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. 
<br>How much is it? My wallet is open and ready. Please release the new menu asap! If you need any taste testers, please call me ><
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear customer {0}, 
<br>
<br>I tasted the fruit chicken just in case to consider alternatives... and you were right...
<br>I don't know how many times I had to rinse my mouth. But the cheese chicken just melted in my mouth, haha. 
<br>I'm sure that this new menu will be a huge success. I'd like to tell you more about how my business is run at the party. 
<br>I think you'd make a very good VFC branch owner one day. Don't forget... 800-XXX-XXXX
<br>See you at the party. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Owner of VFC
<br></div></div></div><div>Be unique! Try the fruit chicken. </div><div><div>Dear Owner of VFC, 
<br>
<br>Cheese is all the rage these days. So cliche. I'm sure businesses have to venture out to succeed. 
<br>So why don't you release the fruit chicken and create a new trend? 
<br>I'm sure VFC can do it! Quality over quantity! I highly recommend it! 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear customer {0}, 
<br>
<br>We taste tested the fruit chicken within the company... and everyone agreed that toothpaste tasted better than this. 
<br>Someone even said that industrial spies would confess to everything if we feed them this. Ahem... 
<br>I can't even imagine what people would have said if we came out with this menu. 
<br>I guess I should leave the taste to professionals :) Nonetheless, that courage... I'm sure that will be a great help to someone else. 
<br>But not us... I'd like to be at the party. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Owner of VFC
<br></div></div></div><div>The chicken of fantasies... Phoenix! </div><div><div>Dear Owner of VFC, 
<br>
<br>You want a new mascot? Well, it has to be a chicken! 
<br>Anyone would know that it's a chicken place then! But a plain chicken is boring, 
<br>so how about a phoenix? Isn't that a fun idea? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear customer {0}, 
<br>
<br>One of the employees actually suggested a phoenix, but everyone rejected the idea. 
<br>They said a plan chicken would be better since it really doesn't have anything to do with our brand... Ahem. 
<br>I wanted a more unique idea, but oh well. Perhaps I will think of something with time. 
<br>I have a lot to work on at the moment, so I will attend the party if I can make time. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Owner of VFC
<br></div></div></div><div>I saw a flyer around town! </div><div><div>Dear Owner of VFC, 
<br>
<br>Hello! I'm {0}, RFA's guest coordinator. 
<br>VFC Chicken! Of course I saw the ads. The flyers are everywhere. It's on every doorstep in town. 
<br>I don't know if it's effective for young people per se, but it's an old method, so I'm sure the influence is undoubtable. 
<br>I guess VFC is going with the classic marketing scheme! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear customer {0}, 
<br>
<br>Oh no... I guess you missed the ambitious commercial we created...
<br>I'll have to check what my marketing team is doing exactly. 
<br>I thought all the young people would know, but ahem. I'll have to make sure our ads are more effective and then visit the party. 
<br>Then please don't forget to call 800-XXX-XXXX when you're craving chicken.

Dear Rika’s Fundraising Association's Guest Coordinator, 

Do you remember the headline "Movie Star A***'s Domestic Violence"?
If so, you'd better forget about it. Since that was not true. 
The headline "Movie Star A***, Actually a Victim" didn't get spread much. And it was true.
Despite the fact that scandalous headlines and articles based on false rumors destroyed a person's career. 
We attempt to be fair and publish proven facts to prevent such incidents. I am the Fair Kang, leader of the Fair Reporters Association. 
Can I ask you, what is your key source of information?

<br>Dear Rika’s Fundraising Association's Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>It's not a bad idea to find information on the internet. I suppose you think that way because you are young. I hope a lot of young people who are informed with facts attend the party. 
<br>
<br>Next question. 
<br>How can the media be fair? 
<br>I will look forward to your answer. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Fair Kang, Leader of FRA 
<br></div></div></div><div>A law must be implemented that protects reporters. </div><div><div>Dear Reporter Kang, 
<br>
<br>A law should be implemented that gives freedom to the press. They have to say what they want. 
<br>Of course, a law that can regulate the press will also have to be implemented. They can't just say anything,  you know? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Rika’s Fundraising Association's Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>You are very wise. If those two harmonize, we might finally have a world with fair press. 
<br>
<br>Lastly, I have to ask you how many facts you know. 
<br>Do you know the breed of Jumin Han's, the son of C&R's Chairman Han, cat? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Fair Kang, Leader of FRA 
<br></div></div></div><div>I cannot tell you that. </div><div><div>Dear Reporter Kang, 
<br>
<br>I can't answer that question. That is private. 
<br>You're not trying to get some info out of me, are you? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Rika’s Fundraising Association's Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Hahaha! You passed the last test. 
<br>You are right. It's very important that you don't provide unnecessary information. 
<br>If you reveal some things based on your mood or the atmosphere, then it will likely be misunderstood. 
<br>I'm very much looking forward to the party... I promise I'll write a fair report on the party. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Fair Kang, Leader of FRA 
<br></div></div></div><div>Persian cat. </div><div><div>Dear Reporter Kang, 
<br>
<br>As far as I know, she's a pure breed. Apparently, she even has a family pedigree. 
<br>She's a pure Persian cat with blue eyes. Hahaha, how about it? I know a lot, don't I?... :) 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Rika’s Fundraising Association's Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Please be wise about whom you share the information with. 
<br>Of course, I will call C&R to confirm tomorrow before I write the article. 
<br>I'll attend the party if I have time after writing the article. 
<br>
<br>Take care. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Fair Kang, Leader of FRA 
<br></div></div></div><div>You have to leave it up to their conscience. </div><div><div>Dear Reporter King, 
<br>
<br>Shouldn't you just leave it to the reporter's conscience? 
<br>My elementary school teacher taught me that conscience always leads us to the right path +_+
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Rika’s Fundraising Association's Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>You are very... innocent. Will there be more innocent ones like you at the party? 
<br>I will go to the party if I don't have anything important to write about. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Fair Kang, Leader of FRA 
<br></div></div></div><div>What I hear from my friends. </div><div><div>Dear Reporter Kang,
<br>
<br>I have this really fun story that I heard from a friend. 
<br>She heard it from her friend and it's so ridiculous! hahaha
<br>Do u wanna hear it? 
<br>
<br>-{0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Rika’s Fundraising Association's Guest Coordinator,

Dear RFA Festa Representative Lady,

Hello, I'm Mark, the wedding planner who makes every wedding beautiful and happy! 
I was very excited to hear about the wedding between a person and a cat... I'm sad it was canceled. 
I always search for unique weddings. I'm wonder what love stories will come out of the party. 
Do you know any unique weddings? 

Best, Mark, Wedding Planner
</div><div>Bae screen wedding</div><div><div>Dear Mark, 
<br>
<br>Hello! I'm {0}, RFA's guest coordinator. 
<br>A unique wedding, hmm... I think it will be very unique to go back and forth between dimensions. 
<br>People shouldn't just stop because their bae character is on screen. It's so beautiful to take on the challenge of breaking dimension barriers! 
<br>The kiss after saying I do will taste like screen protector :) I'm sure this wedding will be remembered by the bride, the groom, and everyone! 
<br>How about it? Doesn't it interest you? :) 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Festa Representative Lady,
<br>
<br>Even I who's planned hundreds of weddings haven't even thought of that! A bae character wedding... I'd love to try. 
<br>If I do plan a bae character wedding, how will I invite the guests? I'm sure it has to be fun just like the wedding. 
<br>I'm getting a lot of ideas, but will you let me know yours? I'd love to hear from you very soon! 
<br>
<br>Best, Mark, Wedding Planner
<br></div></div></div><div>Tripter Tript invitations</div><div><div>Dear Mark, 
<br>
<br>Why don't you invite them through Tripter? 
<br>I'm sure there will be a lot of people on Tripter who'd understand a bae character wedding, so a lot of people will give their blessings. 
<br>And having to convey all the words within 140 letters will be unique too. 
<br>How can you express everything in 140 letters... Maybe it will be 141 letters.... You'll be able to feel that kind of nervous excitement too. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Festa Representative Lady,
<br>
<br>And since people can retript them, more people will mention the wedding. 
<br>Happiness is greater when shared, right? Then... how will we take care of photography? 
<br>I'm sure the wedding will become more special with your ideas. 
<br>
<br>Best, Mark, Wedding Planner
<br></div></div></div><div>Use screenshot function! </div><div><div>Dear Mark, 
<br>
<br>I don't know if this will meet your expectations... but I have an idea! 
<br>The theme of this wedding we're thinking of is a "wedding to surpass dimensions", right? 
<br>We can place a virtual camera for the bride on the groom's side, and if we use the screenshot function, 
<br>I'm sure we can produce a wedding photograph that suits our theme... How about it? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Festa Representative Lady,
<br>
<br>Wow, I didn't even think of that. 
<br>All I could think of was showing the groom on a big screen and having the bride stand in front of it. 
<br>I almost want to establish a company with you. I'm smiling while reading your email, and my boyfriend's staring at me. 
<br>If I could take my boyfriend to the party, I can introduce you to him and tell him how creative you are. 
<br>Then I'll look forward to seeing you! 
<br>
<br>Best, Mark, Wedding Planner
<br></div></div></div><div>Good! Let's hire a famous photographer! </div><div><div>Dear Mark, 
<br>
<br>People always say that all that's left are photos. 
<br>I think we should be very careful when taking photographs. So we can hire a famous photographer.
<br>How do people usually take photographs in weddings? Was it family-distant family-friend, in that order? Even if it's costly, I think it'll only take about an hour. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Festa Representative Lady,
<br>
<br>The photographer is special but the order is not special at all. 2% short of being perfect. 
<br>Still, you've inspired me, so I should think more about it. 
<br>I'll come up with an amazing idea so you just wait for me this time! 
<br>
<br>Best, Mark, Wedding Planner 
<br></div></div></div><div>Handmade invitation letters</div><div><div>Dear Mark, 
<br>
<br>Why don't you create a one and only handmade invitation letter? 
<br>Nothing will be more special than a letter hand-decorated by the bride herself. 
<br>I think it will be meaningful to everyone! 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Festa Representative Lady,
<br>
<br>Hmm, that's a good idea!. 
<br>
<br>That's what I'd like to say, but this wedding is suppose to surpass all dimensions.  
<br>How are you going to send the letters to the world inside the screen? I don't think it can be a happy wedding until we solve this..
<br>Still, it's a good idea, so I'll use it for a different wedding. 
<br>First, we should have more time to brainstorm for this bae character wedding! 
<br>
<br>Best, Mark, Wedding Planner 
<br></div></div></div><div>Advertising balloon wedding</div><div><div>Dear Mark, 
<br>
<br>Hello. I'm {0}, RFA's guest coordinator. 
<br>I think a wedding up in the sky will be very unique! 
<br>The bride and groom can go up the sky with advertising balloons. I think it'll be fun for them to go on their honeymoon that way! How about it? 
<br>Does it interest you? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Festa Representative Lady,
<br>
<br>Oh, that's a shame. I've planned almost every wedding out there. 
<br>I've done skydiving weddings, bungee jump weddings, hang glider weddings, helicopter weddings... 
<br>and even advertising balloon weddings. 
<br>I guess I was expecting too much. 
<br>
<br>-Mark, Wedding Planner

How can I help you?

</div><div>I wanted to help you. </div><div><div>Dear admirable Ms. Only, 
<br>
<br>Hello. I hope you're having a good day! 
<br>I'm not here to complain about anything. I wanted to invite you to a party. 
<br>There is a very emotionless member in the RFA. 
<br>I thought that you'd be able to give him lots of advice if you come. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, {0}
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear customer {0}, 
<br>
<br>Yes of course~! 
<br>I searched a way for me to assist you.
<br>If you are referring to someone emotionless, why doesn't he take a job that requires emotional labor? 
<br>Since he will have to repress his emotions and provide the best service, I think he will do very well. 
<br>Is there anything else I can assist you with? 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, Cry Only, aiming to provide the best customer service
<br></div></div></div><div>I want to go see a movie but I don't have anyone to go with. What do I do? </div><div><div>Dear admirable Ms. Only, 
<br>
<br>You are so kind. I guess I should answer your question? 
<br>If I have to pick something that's been troubling me, there's this new movie I want to go see but I don't have anyone to go with me. 
<br>I'm very sad that no one will keep me warm. 
<br>What should I do?

<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Customer {0}, 
<br>
<br>Oh, I see~ I apologize for your inconvenience. 
<br>Movies can be entertaining even when you go alone. I go to the theater by myself from time to time. I think it's better because you can laugh or cry however you want. 
<br>I went to see the 7th installment of Universe Battle on my own a couple days ago. 
<br>Why don't you try it as well? :)

<br>
<br>You really do provide the best customer service. 
<br>If I have one last issue, it's that

<br>Personal bank account? The fund is to be used for the organization, but it's put into a personal account?

Hey! 

I heard that those hater are going crazy somewhere again. 
Before I can go there and fight back, 
please reveal your IP address! 

Best, Love Commenter, the Internet Protector(192.168.0.1)
</div><div>1.0.0.1</div><div><div>Hello, Love Commener
<br>
<br>I always admire your work. I was so moved by your love comments that I wanted to invite you to the RFA party. 
<br>My IP(Internet Protocol) address is 1.0.0.1.
<br>Do you feel safe now? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}, RFA's Guest Coordinator
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA's Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Oh, that's a very healthy IP. I can trust you just by the fact that you're server's in this country. 
<br>What's the RFA party like? I hope all the guests like writing love comments? 
<br>Hmm... I'm not being skeptical or anything.. but I need to test you. 
<br>What would you write in a comment when someone uploads a pretty boring Youtube video? 
<br>
<br>Best, Love Commenter, the Internet Protector(192.168.0.1)
<br></div></div></div><div>I'll look forward to your next video! :) </div><div><div>Dear Love Commenter, 
<br>
<br>Even though that video wasn't fun, I guess you have to tell them you'll still be watching the next one. 
<br>They'll feel much better with some encouragement. 
<br>I'm sure the Youtuber will get it but still not be upset about it. 
<br>
<br>Best, RFA Guest Coordinator
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Yeah! You're right! Internet should be a place where people know how to encourage each other, 
<br>but so many vicious words are being sent back and forth in the name of freedom. 
<br>And the thing about internet comments is that it's very easy for them to get one-sided. 
<br>If someone at the RFA writes a hate comment, how would you handle it? 
<br>
<br>Best, Love Commenter, the Internet Protector(192.168.0.1)
<br></div></div></div><div>Report them. </div><div><div>Hello Love Commenter, 
<br>
<br>I heard that writing hate comments is a habit. In order to let them know that they have to be polite in the internet space, unfortunately I will have to report them. Sometimes you just have to be firm. 
<br>
<br>Best, RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Yes. You shouldn't just report anyone, but acting passively just for the sake of being nice will only bring more anger. It's not about just protecting yourself! 
<br>Even people who write hate comments can start writing love comments after they realize their crime. You are very wise. 
<br>I will attend that party. See you there. 
<br>
<br>Best, Love Commenter, the Internet Protector(192.168.0.1)
<br></div></div></div><div>Have mercy. </div><div><div>Hello Love Commenter, 
<br>
<br>Is there anything more beautiful than having mercy? I get to be merciful and become free. At times that's the best. 
<br>
<br>Best, RFA Guest Coordinator
<br></div><div>
<br>Dar RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>Hmm... I respect your opinion but hate comments can become worse with that attitude. People usually write hate comments subconsciously. Sometimes you really have to confront them and let them know they are writing hate comments. Well... I guess you wouldn't know very well. 
<br>If I don't see a lot of hate comments that day, I will go to the party. 
<br>
<br>Best, Love Commenter, the Internet Protector(192.168.0.1)
<br></div></div></div><div>This video is total trash lol</div><div><div>Hello Love Commenter, 
<br>
<br>We all have the freedom to say something is bad if we want to. 
<br>And if we wanna diss someone, we have to do it properly! 
<br>I think I'll write something like "this video is total trash lol"
<br>Alliteration! Great, no? :-) 
<br>
<br>Best, RFA Guest Coordinator
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Guest Coordinator, 
<br>
<br>I should go report your IP address or something haha
<br>Nah, I'm just kidding lolol
<br>I'm receiving too many reports these days. 
<br>After I properly report them all, I'll go to the party if I have time.

Dear RFA Party's Beautiful Flower, 

Hello gorgeous. 

Your beautiful nose, lips, and ears are telling me that you really are the most beautiful flower in the world. 
I'm... from the clinic. Just so that you will be the only one who knows the secret of your beauty. 
What treatment will be able to lock up your heart? 

Love, Lake Na, the one who broke the lake ice with his heavenly beauty
</div><div>Treatment of getting locked up in a room of mirros. </div><div><div>Dear Mr. Na, Owner of Narcissism Clinic
<br>
<br>Hello, you really are very handsome, haha. 
<br>It's not that I'm suffering from narcissism, but I have a friend who has quite severe symptoms. 
<br>If he has to seek treatment, how about getting locked up in a room full of mirrors? 
<br>If he has to see handsome faces all around him... he'll end up muttering to himself that faces with the beauty of gods must pay for their sins. Then he'll become more humble? 
<br>
<br>Please come to the RFA party and tell that to my friend. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}, RFA Guest Coordinator
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party's Beautiful Flower, 
<br>
<br>Oh... It's your friend, not you in danger. I do shine in parties. 
<br>First, I'll have to know the symptoms to see whether or not he's treatable.
<br>Do you see any symptoms in particular? 
<br>
<br>Love, Lake Na, the one who broke the lake ice with his heavenly beauty
<br></div></div></div><div>He takes a lot of selfies. </div><div><div>Dear Mr. Na, Owner of Narcissism Clinic
<br>
<br>Hmm... His thing is that he takes a lot of selfies. 
<br>Thanks to that, a couple people in the group chat room frequently suffer. 
<br>How about it? Is he treatable? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}, RFA Guest Coordinator
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party's Beautiful Flower, 
<br>
<br>If that's it, then he's treatable. That means he's fully aware of himself. 
<br>But... in your eyes, who's more handsome, me or him? 
<br>
<br>Love, Lake Na, the one who broke the lake ice with his heavenly beauty
<br></div></div></div><div>Lake Na </div><div><div>Dear Mr. Na, Owner of Narcissism Clinic
<br>
<br>Personally, you are more my taste, haha. 
<br>I wish Zen's a bit more... buttery if you know what I mean. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}, RFA Guest Coordinator
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party's Beautiful Flower, 
<br>
<br>Then I suppose I'll have to attend the party, 
<br>to treat him, and to show you my heavenly beauty :) 
<br>
<br>Alright, cute kitty. See you at the party. 
<br>Make sure you bring some sedatives so you don't get a heart attack after seeing me haha
<br>
<br>Love, Lake Na, the one who broke the lake ice with his heavenly beauty
<br></div></div></div><div>Zen</div><div><div>Dear Mr. Na, Owner of Narcissism Clinic
<br>
<br>Of course, it's Zen. Are you comparing SD with HD right now? I mean, come on. 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}, RFA Guest Coordinator
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party's Beautiful Flower, 
<br>
<br>You could have just chose to be nice to me, 
<br>but you chose to be honest. 
<br>
<br>The main treatment my clinic offers 
<br>has to do something with lying. 
<br>You have to go through a step of lying to myself that I'm not really handsome... 
<br>but seeing that you are honest, I don't think you're ready yet. lol
<br>Maybe people at the party won't be either. 
<br>
<br>I'll have to think about going to the party. 
<br>
<br>Love, Lake Na, the one who broke the lake ice with his heavenly beauty
<br></div></div></div><div>He takes a long shower. </div><div><div>Dear Mr. Na, Owner of Narcissism Clinic
<br>
<br>Zen takes... very long showers. Maybe because he wants to see his body longer. 
<br>Please tell me a way to get rid of narcissism, Mr. Na!! 
<br>
<br>Best, {0}, RFA Guest Coordinator
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party's Beautiful Flower, 
<br>
<br>Oh no... Taking a long shower is a serious symptom... T_T 
<br>The bathroom is the perfect space to become narcissistic. 
<br>The dense steam and mirror... when these two come together, your body looks 250% better than usual. 
<br>A couple of my patients have dropped their phones in water while taking selfies during the shower. 
<br>
<br>Hmm.... He might be a bit impossible, your friend.
<br>I'll go to the party if I think of a way to save him. 
<br>
<br>Love, Lake Na, the one who broke the lake ice with his heavenly beauty
<br></div></div></div><div>Treatment of shoving your face in sand and swimming. </div><div><div>Dear Mr. Na, Owner of Narcissism Clinic
<br>
<br>Well, first you have to make the person ugly. 
<br>Why doesn't he just bury his face in the sand and swim around? His skin will completely dry out and age him :-)
<br>
<br>Best, {0}, RFA Guest Coordinator
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear RFA Party's Beautiful Flower, 
<br>
<br>...How dare you think to damage one's looks? 
<br>I think you need to respect the value of beauty more. 
<br>

HA HA HA

Amazing that you've managed to find me. 
"I'll enforce justice on all the wrongdoings in this world! Online and Offline!"

That is my motto. 
Now, I've already done a background check on you. 

You want to invite to me your party, right? 

-B1ack*Cat
</div><div>Yes, there is injustice going on so please come to our party and help us! </div><div><div>SOS! Dear Black Cat, 
<br>
<br>I saw a couple days ago that you investigated a hit and run accident, and found the culprit through the black box video. I instantly became a fan! 
<br>Something horrible has happened to the RFA. We are all waiting for you! 
<br>Please come and help us find justice! SOS

<br>
<br>Well if you're that desperate... Good attitude. 
<br>But I do not work for fame or money. I only work for justice! 
<br>At times, my justice has resulted in bad technologies, 
<br>so some call me half-knight of justice. 
<br>
<br>Although during the day, I work at an office as a server developer, 
<br>at night, I become the defender of justice. 
<br>
<br>This duality within me... Do you understand it? 
<br>
<br>B1ack*Cat
<br></div></div></div><div>There's no story of a magic girl who's not violent. </div><div><div>SOS! Dear Black Cat, 
<br>
<br>Do you know what the biggest contradiction is for children cartoons? 
<br>It's that the defenders of justice use violence against the villains. 
<br>
<br>Of course, you can't say they are just wrong... 
<br>But defending justice peacefully... doesn't just happen because one side tries. 
<br>Much time and effort are needed for that to happen. 
<br>But our lives are finite. 
<br>If you just work in the office without having any dreams... your life will be so boring. 
<br>It's admirable that you've become the online investigator king.

<br>You completely understand the contradiction within me, amazing. I can't disagree to a single thing. 
<br>I haven't met someone so interesting in a while, I'm getting pretty excited. Haha... 
<br>Even if my boss hates me... even when my wife nags me... a man has dreams. 
<br>
<br>Now, then last question. 
<br>Why is my username Black Cat? 
<br>
<br>B1ack*Cat
<br></div></div></div><div>It's cool... Completely suits you :) </div><div><div>SOS! Dear Black Cat, 
<br>
<br>I honestly don't know the reason, but it's so cool~! 
<br>You roam around empty streets as if they're your home... 
<br>and defend justice without getting any compliments... Someone so cool and solemn... 
<br>Black Cat is the perfect name :)
<br>You'll come to the party, right? 
<br>

<br></div><div>

<br>
<br>If that's what you think, there won't be any need to know the exact meaning. 
<br>
<br>I will definitely attend the party.
<br>It will be my first outing in a while. 
<br>
<br>-C00L B1ack*Cat
<br></div></div></div><div>Is your pet cat black? </div><div><div>SOS! Dear Black Cat, 
<br>
<br>People usually have meaningless usernames. 
<br>I used to have one called Sauce Eating Chicken, 
<br>and it literally meant nothing. lol
<br>Maybe that's your name because your pet cat is black? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0} RFA Guest Coordinator
<br></div><div>
<br>Username {0},
<br>
<br>No, the reason my username is Black Cat... is because I've used this since Netscape was around.
<br>I was the first one who used the name Black Cat... in the famous old game Land of Flute. No one else can use it because it's mine. 
<br>But I don't know why people can't connect that old me to the present me... Gosh... People have pathetic memories. 
<br>
<br>Anyways, about the party. 
<br>My daughter is going on a field trip, so I might have to pack her lunch that day. 
<br>I'll talk with my wife and attend if everything works out. 
<br>
<br>B1ack*Cat
<br></div></div></div><div>I think I know... When you're hopeless about life... you have to drink a beer and play a round. </div><div><div>SOS! Dear Black Cat, 
<br>
<br>I know that feeling. It's emptiness. Isn't it very lonely? 
<br>You don't feel like you're resting even when you come home? Build your own man cave. 
<br>Sit in front of the computer, drink beer, and try playing a game you enjoyed as a kid :) 
<br>New World is the bomb these days.

<br>I don't quite understand what you mean. 
<br>
<br>I don't drink. My body doesn't take it very well. 
<br>I heard there will be champagne at the RFA party? 
<br>I'll have to think about attending then. 
<br>
<br>Take care.
<br>
<br>B1ack*Cat
<br></div></div></div><div>You should be honored that you're invited. </div><div><div>SOS! Dear Black Cat, 
<br>
<br>The RFA party is a very private and exclusive party~ 
<br>Throw away your boring work clothes and prepare a lux suit. 
<br>The moment you come, you will consider it an honor to be invited. 
<br>
<br>I'll be waiting, hahaha.

Hahaha... hello.

I heard I'll be solving a fun puzzle with you. 
Adventures exciting like discovering treasures hidden by our ancestors! 
New cases that will make my heart race! 
If you know any such event, please tell my assistant, Watt. 

-Sherlocking
</div><div>I know the vanished seven treasure islands. </div><div><div>Dear Sherlocking, the Master Investigator, 
<br>
<br>I thought of you after reading about seven ancient treasure islands that have disappeared. 
<br>Islands are not always visible to us. 
<br>There are so many more places under the sea that we haven't explored. 
<br>Maybe deep in the sea... there will be treasure islands full of gold and rare gems. 
<br>Why don't you come to the party if you want to hear more? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0} RFA Guest Coordinator
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Provider of Mystery Clue,
<br>
<br>Oh!!!! You know such an important clue!! 
<br>I'm trembling!! So exciting!! Hooray!! 
<br>Oh my... I'd like to get more excited, but it's time for Watt to return. 
<br>I should pretend like I don't know anything.
<br>I'm sorry, but do the other members know of amazing treasures too? 
<br>Any clue is fine. 
<br>

<br></div></div></div><div>Yoosung's LOLOL exploration</div><div><div>Dear Sherlocking, the Master Investigator, 
<br>
<br>I heard there are many mysteries within the game called LOLOL. 
<br>The seven treasure islands I just mentioned... might be hidden in the oceans of LOLOL. 
<br>RFA's Yoosung Kim, who is currently ranked number 2 on the Shooting Star server has the ability explore every corner of the LOLOL world...
<br>How about it? Don't you want more details? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0} RFA Guest Coordinator

<br>Dear Provider of Mystery Clue,
<br>
<br>An online game... that didn't even occur to me! 
<br>I'm fairly old-schooled. 
<br>I'm extraordinarily good at chemistry and biology... but not so much with computers. 
<br>I'm typing with two fingers right now. 
<br>I definitely... need to learn about computers. 
<br>Will there be a guest at the party who can teach me about computers? 
<br>Please answer asap.
<br>
<br>-Sherlocking
<br></div></div></div><div>Chief Assistant Jaehee Kang</div><div><div>Dear Sherlocking, the Master Investigator, 
<br>
<br>You will be pleased! The perfect person will be at the party.
<br>I know someone who's endured and survived two years and a half of pulling all nighters and working late. 
<br>Rumors say she handle an enormous number of documents every day, and considering her boss' personality, 
<br>Chief Assistant Jaehee Kang is a very patient person.
<br>
<br>I'm sure she'll be the perfect one to teach you.
<br>Now... you don't have any choice but to come to the party, right? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0} RFA Guest Coordinator
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Provider of Mystery Clue,
<br>
<br>!!!
<br>See you at the party.
<br>I'll have to inform Watt immediately!!

<br></div></div></div><div>707</div><div><div>Dear Sherlocking, the Master Investigator, 
<br>
<br>There is 707, the best hacker I know of. 
<br>I heard he's the best in the industry... but I'm not sure about that. 
<br>I am sure, however, that is very good at computers. 
<br>
<br>How about it? Wanna see him? Wanna come to the party? 
<br>
<br>Best, {0} RFA Guest Coordinator
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Provider of Mystery Clue,
<br>
<br>707...?
<br>He's the one who's interfered with my investigations on multiple occasions...! 
<br>He'd hack into all the evidence I've collected and send them off to his agency. 
<br>He's going to be at the party?
<br>Hmm... I'll go if I manage to find a giant net and a spear. 
<br>
<br>-Sherlocking 
<br></div></div></div><div>A mystery on Zen's musical script!? </div><div><div>Dear Sherlocking, the Master Investigator, 
<br>
<br>I'm not really sure, but one of our members, Zen, always reads his script. 
<br>Maybe there will be some secret code on the script?? 
<br>
<br>Should I take it to the party?
<br>
<br>Best, {0} RFA Guest Coordinator
<br></div><div>
<br>Dear Provider of Mystery Clue,
<br>
<br>...Hmm, 
<br>that is a quite fresh idea, 
<br>but it is pathetic nonetheless.
<br>Still, reading it won't do me any harm, 
<br>so I'll go to the party if I feel like it. 
<br>
<br>Then take care. 
<br>
<br>-Sherlocking. 
<br></div></div></div><div>Please find my socks my grandma's dog ate. </div><div><div>Dear Provider of Mystery Clue,
<br>
<br>This happened when I was little. 
<br>I was staying at my grandma's house, and she had a spotted dog named Spottie. 
<br>He was so cute but I always worried that he'll eat me alive because he was so big and got so excited when he saw me. 
<br>Anyways, one day he kept licking my foot and ended up eating one of my socks. 
<br>He didn't throw up no matter how much I patted his back. 
<br>I'm sure that it came out in his poop...
<br>but is there anyway I can get it back? 
<br>
